I learned in my social psychology class that even if an inapropriate joke about women is made among male co-workers and a woman over hears and is offended, that is sexual harassment. They can be brought up on charges and potentially loose their jobs. I think that female discrimination is the one that we see in the public eye the most but that does not mean that men are never discriminated against. Little children are taught with falsh cards. They see the male doctor and the female nurse. What is a man did not want to be a full time doctor? What if he wanted to a nurse? We have been conditioned since an early age that this would be breaking some kind of social norm. Even a stay at home dad sounds creepy in today's society although it is getting better and only time will help that. These breaking of social norms are becomming more and more normal and only time will tell if gender discrimination will be a thing of the past.\"},\n",

       "   'output': 'Privacy rights are a big issue in our nation today. Honestly, I am not sure why this is. I think it is because I am one of the norm. I am a white, catholic, American girl with absolutely nothing to hide. I do not believe that the government would ever want to invade my privacy. However, if they did, I trust my government enough to know that they must have had a valid reason for doing so and that it was for the betterment of the country, which I am all for, especially after the tragedy of September 11, 2001. My beliefs about privacy rights are as follows, if you do not trust your government to have valid reasoning for invading privacy, then you should leave. The government’s intention is only to protect you from potential danger or to keep you from endangering the country. This angers me so much when people do not agree with the government having access to some personal aspects of a citizens life. If you do not want the government invading your privacy, don’t do anything that would make them think that you’re going to endanger the country, that is not asking for much. The government has many other things to do and much more important things to do than to tap you phone call with you friend Jen about you plans for the weekend. What I am trying to say is that the government wont invade your privacy if you don’t give them a reason to. It is that simple. Like the school officials, that kid gave them a reason to suspect him of endangering the school and its students. I do believe that this was not an invasion of privacy because by putting that information on myspace, that kid no longer had any privacy. Myspace is a public network. I don’t believe anything on the internet is private. Invasion of privacy or not, the school officials made the right decision because they prevented a potential life threatening act. Who knows how many children and teachers could have been killed that day? Is this kids privacy really the top priority? I think that is ridiculous to even be thinking about that. I believe that the only reason the government should only invade privacy if they have reason to believe that that person is going to endanger themselves or someone else. I also think that I have these views because I am a part of the majority. If I was a teenage boy from Afghanistan I would probably have a different outlook on privacy rights. I think privacy rights and racial profiling however are two separate issues. And, unfortunately, because I was personally effected very much by September 11th, I do not have any problem with racial profiling. If it will promote the safety of our country then I do not have a problem with it. If they do not like it then they do not belong here. As harsh as that is, I do not believe that we should cater to anyone just because that would be abiding by their privacy rights. When it comes to national security, I believe that privacy rights do not matter at that point.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'In the terrorist attack of 2001, I lost many close friends and relatives. I live right outside the city so I was affected greatly. When this first happened I was in eighth grade and even at that age, I developed a prejudice against middle eastern people. I could not stand the sight of them. I got chills when I watched the news and the re-runs of what happened that day. When I first witnessed the attacks on the towers, the first thing that popped into my mind was war. I wanted to get revenge on the terrorists so badly. I can only imagine what President Bush thought that day. His people were attacked and killed that day for no reason. Of course he was mad, upset, angry and distraught. I think President Bush had the hardest job of all that day and they days after the attacks. My first decision, as his, would have been to go to war. Although this was a rash and irrational decision, I think it was necessary at the time. We could not just let the terrorists kill our friends and relatives and just stand there and watch. Something had to be done as a response to what they did. We had to at least try and stop them. President Bush’s only mistake, I think, was how long we ended up staying in and occupying Iraq. I think by staying in Iraq we are only killing more of our men and women and we are getting nothing done. And, what we have done, will fall apart the second we leave. Those people are just not able to function in a normal society. If they cannot get along with and work with each other, how are we supposed to organize rules and laws so that they can live in peace? I think the men of the middle east are the most ungrateful people. By occupying Iraq further, we are not making any progress. All we can do now is protect ourselves because we know that they will always be a threat because they hate the United States. Because I was affected so greatly that day, it is still hard for me to look at middle eastern people not be disturbed, scared, or angry. I think it is in our best interest to pull out of Iraq and try not to deal with them at all. As the war has shown, there is not much that we can do that will stay in place. If they cannot get along with each other, I don’t think anyone can expect President Bush to solve all of their internal problems. All he can do now is protect out country with all that he can. I think the men and women that are stationed in Iraq should return home and we should heighten security instead of trying to solve Iraq’s problems. I think that the government should focus on the United States’ gaps in security and problems. This is all that we can do. President Bush cannot create miracles.'},\n",

Women now have rights and society places a heavier emphasis on different things and issues than the people of Jesus’ time did. I do not understand the why priests cannot marry. They say that they are supposed to be married to God and devote their life to God and his teachings. There is no reason why these men cannot have wives and families and still be faithful to God. I am sure that they now have other interests than God, such as a favorite sport or hobby. Is this taking away from their life with God? Not really. There is also no reason that women cannot be priest. In fact, there were even women priests and preachers in Jesus’ day. With all the rights that women have and all the equality that we have achieved should enable women to have the opportunity to be more than nuns. I think allowing priests to marry would have definitely helped to avoid most of the cases of pedophilia. Some men that are sick just go into the priesthood to hide their true identity and they are not even devoted to God. If they were allowed to have wives there wouldn’t be the problem of sexual tension that is arising today. Priests are humans too. I am not saying that sexual relations are necessary for life but I think having that significant other in your life is very important and not something that one should have to give up in order to be devoted to God and his teachings. I believe that God wants everyone to do the best that they can in all that they do and most importantly, to be happy. I think priests of today’s society would appreciate the fact that they have the option to have a family and not have to make that decision. I also believe that women priests would be a great asset to the Catholic Church, something new and refreshing. Some women may feel awkward repenting their sins to a man all the time. Maybe some would feel more comfortable talking to a woman. This might encourage more people to become active in the church and encourage women to further their faith. I know that I would feel much more comfortable talking to a woman about the things that I have done wrong. I feel like they are more nurturing and that they care more about how you feel than a man would. I feel like the men are just concerned about telling you what you have to do to make up for your sins. I don’t feel like they always just want to talk about things. I would also love to go to a mass that was done by a woman priest. That would be so new and so interesting. The catholic church has to find a happy medium where they can keep their tradition and also adapt to the constantly changing times. This will only help to better educate the people of today, by adapting to their way of life and relating to their day to day problems and concerns.'},\n",

It is crucial for any instution to be adaptable to the changing times but also to keep their tradition alive to some extent. They have already modified the fasting laws and the age that people are allowed to fast. I think that there is no reason why women should not be able to further themselves by becoming priests. They even had women priests in Jesus' day. Women are equal to men in this society and if the Church refuses to recognize that then I think they are up against a very large community of angry women. I also understand that priest take an oath to be faithful and married to God, however, I do not understand why God would not want them to experience the joys of married and family life and for them to share God with their families. I think it would only benefit the Catholic communtiy seeing the priest with his family and how they act. It would be a good model for the community. It would also keep mentally ill men from joining the priesthood to cover up their pediphilia. This is a sick thing that has happened in the Church and I believe that it could be avoided by giving priests the option to marry.\"},\n",

They do not have time to just tap phone calls to see what Jenny is doing tonight nor do they care. They should draw the line by only going on concrete evidence. The school officials in this case were well within their rights. They recieved a threat to their students and they did something about it. This is what we would hope they would do.

I do not understand why it is important for the gay community to be \"married\" in the eyes of the Church, an institution that has made it clear that they do not support their way of life. The states that have legalied gay marriage I think are over stepping their bounds. I think this is between the gay community and the Church not Bush and not the States. I think Bush should have nothing to do with this issue. He is imposing his personal views on the subject on the entire country which is wrong and unjust. Gay marriage has nothing to do with the federal government.

       "   'output': 'I think that gender discrimination is an ongoing issue in the United States. While it’s being shown that we are slowly improving this, there is still much room in which we can eliminate discrimination. Statistics even today show that women make lower wages than men do in many companies. Some places this difference is really subtle, but in others the gaps are much more apparent. Just the fact that employers must show their employees videos about sexual harassment and gender discrimination proves the existence of many places in which this discrimination is still existing today. I feel that this is a continuing idea of an outdated mindset that women are inferior to men and their place is in the home rather than in the business. This mindset not only restricts the rights of other human beings, but also slows down progress that could be made by having women do the same jobs as men. The job market is not even the biggest source of discrimination of women. A lot of this discrimination comes from in the home or even just at social gatherings. Many families assign roles based on gender. The man will mow the lawn, fix broken appliances, etc while the woman does the grocery shopping, cleans, and does the cooking. While this is not true in all families, it is in many. A child growing up in one of these families will assume that this is the way it is supposed to be and in turn become discriminatory, even if not intentional. The best way to work on getting rid of discrimination in the workplace and at home is for women to show that they can do all of the same things as men, and for men to learn to accept change. This should not be a forceful thing, but more of a mutual issue that should be solved. The use of force may solve the problems revolving around earnings and jobs held in the house, but will only increase tensions. This in the long run will only lead to make the situation worse and in reality, nothing will be solved. However, if both sides can stoop down to the same level, neither will be able to overpower the other and eventually change will make way. While gender related jokes can get you a good chuckle sometimes, it is best to try to get rid of these. Though the message is supposed to be “out of the loop” and only meant to be funny, it also plants stereotypes in your mind. So all in all, the best ways to get rid of gender discrimination would be for men and women alike to begin ignoring these jokes and stereotypes. After the stereotypes have been eliminated from both men and women, both sides can begin to progress to a more efficient non-discriminatory society. Women will get more jobs and men will learn not to question this, wages will level out for both genders and soon enough these will even apply to the household.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"My thoughts on marijuana are that it should be legal for people over 21. Marijuana's effects aren't very similar to alcohol though. The effects of marijuana are in fact much less inhibiting. Alcohol causes you to slur your speech, fall over, overestimate your own abilities (such as being able to drive a car), and more or less deals a lot more damage healthwise (like it does to your liver and brain). Marijuana on the other hand slows down the thought process, gives you a lightheaded-highlike feeling, increases philosophical thought and significantly increases appetite. While smoking anything can cause potential health risks, marijuana does much less damage to the brain than alcohol does. In fact, some studies are beginning to point out some of the medical uses of marijuana, and one has even been set out to try to show that marijuana actually increases brain cell growth. If it were a match of which should be legal between alcohol and marijuana, my vote would go towards marijuana. However, I feel that both should be legal anyway, especially since the effects of marijuana are much less detremental both in the short term and long term.

The beliefs within the Catholic Church are their beliefs and it is not up to anybody but themselves to decide whether to change their ways or not. Though I feel it would be nice if they were to become more open about certain issues (allowing female priests, allowing gay marriage, etc) I don’t feel that it is in my power, public power, or the governments power to force them to change. This would be no different than them forcing their beliefs on everybody else. The whole ordeal with pedophilia within the Catholic Church has been restricted to only several locations and people tend to make a bigger deal out of it than it actually is. There is pedophilia in many more places than the Catholic Church and people only see it as a big deal there because priests are supposed to be moral teachers to those who attend the church. In order to deal with this issue it would be best if they were to get background checks on who is becoming a priest and determine their real motive. Most priests and members of the Catholic Church frown upon this behavior and see it as a disgrace. While some of the views held within the Catholic Church are outdated, nobody should force them to flow with the sands of time. If part of their belief system relies on following works of the past, then so be it. As long as they allow me to go about my own personal business, I have no problem with allowing them to go about theirs. They disagree with what I believe and I may disagree with what they believe. That is how our society functions. It is not a “one way” nation. Freedom is what allows us to keep our same views, even if they are the same views that we’ve had for centuries and it is what allows us to change our views, even if it goes against the grain. I don’t think that anything can really be done to prevent cases of pedophilia or any other kind of church corruption since this is all reliant on the person. Whether it be those who are in charge of the church or the priest themselves, what happens relies on them and it is up for the people of the church to speak up against it, not someone who is not a member. For example: I am not an employee of a McDonalds, therefore I have no right to rise up against the McDonalds manager and try to bring him down. Granted, changes could be made for the better of the employees, I would not have a full blown knowledge of the entire situation. This is not to say that what is going on is right. By no means is it right to allow this to take place. That is why we have the court system, where religion is forgotten and the law is brought in.

       "   'output': 'Gender discrimination will always exist for the same reason any discrimination will always exist – people are different. If someone is different from everybody else, that is an easy and obvious target for another person to put them down, regardless of what motivates the bully. That being said, I believe that gender discrimination has come a long way in the past few decades. Through the Women’s Rights movement and other similar activism, I think certain people have succeeded in convincing the American public as a whole treat everyone a little more fairly. All that anyone can ask is that people be treated with respect in public, no matter what private opinions people hold. So, while there will never be a complete eradication of gender discrimination in America, we are on the right track to making everyone treat each other with the most respect possible. Women hold the short end of the stick as far as gender discrimination is concerned. This is because the man has held a higher social status throughout history. Even if we look back as recent as the early 1900’s, men were primarily the head of the household, holding the higher paying job. Women were considered the homemakers, and if they even had a job at all their professions were limited to short list, such as teachers or nurses. After the World Wars, when the men were sent off to war, women started to fill in for the positions that up until then were reserved for men. This probably had a lot to do with women gaining more respect as a demographic, because it proved that most of the jobs done by men could also be done by women as well. In present day, women have just as good a chance at getting a job as men do applying for the same position. However, there still remain fields of work that are statistically held primarily by men, such as engineering and some of the other fields of science. This may be because women simply aren’t attracted to those jobs as much as they are to other jobs. Whatever the cause, the lack of female employees in these lines of work still leave the door wide open for discrimination. For example, since there are not many women scientists, one could make the faulty correlation that women don’t excel at subjects such as math or science as men do. Since there will never be an exact 50/50 ratio of men and women at all jobs, this type of reasoning for gender discrimination will always exist to some point. Men can be discriminated against in the workplace to a lesser degree, but for different reasons. As mentioned before, some occupations were classically held by women. When men start to apply and work at these jobs, they can be viewed as feminine. American culture as a whole unfortunately still holds the belief that men should be manly and macho. Therefore, men who hold these jobs are open to a different brand of gender discrimination.'},\n",

With soldiers dying thousands of miles from home in Iraq as part of a war that the nation is divided on, and other domestic topics such as whether abortion is murder or not, whether two people of the same sex decide to get married should not be that major of a concern. However, since it is such a popular topic, that means in some way that people should decide what their opinion is on whether or not gay marriage should be legalized. In my opinion, if two people of the same sex think getting married is the right thing to do to make them happy, then let them do it. It doesn’t matter what anyone else’s opinion is, this is America – home of the free. This country was built in order for people to escape the oppression of other governments. As the poem “The New Colossus” engraved on the Statue of Liberty declares, America calls to the world, “Give me your tired, your poor, / your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” When our country embraces such an ethic, it seems unfair to deny two people a simple right that is based on love. If we do deny them this right, then America has lost its identity as a haven for the oppressed. President George Bush’s call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is simply ridiculous. First of all, we should have learned our lesson when we tampered with the constitution during prohibition. Since we had to go right back and amend the constitution just for the sake of declaring the prohibition amendment invalid, the simple moral of thinking through what is or is not important enough to amend the constitution should have been made clear. Also, the Declaration of Independence famously states the American citizen’s right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Now, I do not pretend to be a scholar of political science, but if there is an amendment to ban gay marriage, there would be some officially documented contradictions in Washington, specifically regarding the “pursuit of happiness” clause. Lastly, the federal government should not only not be involved in the issue of gay marriage, but they should not even care about whether two gay people decide to be married. That is a private decision between two people that should be respected by the government. The government should only be involved so much as to determine whether or not gay married couples get the same benefits as heterosexual married couples. However, if gay married couples were denied the same benefits from the government as heterosexual married couples, then that would count as discrimination. Discrimination of any kind by the federal government is inappropriate, so by logic gay couples should receive the same rights.'},\n",

By definition, an “invasion” of privacy would imply that the school officials went above and beyond normal means to obtain private information about a student. First of all, logging onto the internet and going to a website is not by any means going above and beyond normal means, and second of all any information on the internet that you don’t even need a password to access is by any means private! School officials – especially the ones in charge of safety – not only shouldn’t be scorned for scanning these websites from time to time, but they should be encouraged to. Police and other authorities scan these pages all the time to successfully help prevent child molesters, sexual predators and other various incarnations of stalkers from harming or abusing other people. No line should be drawn when it comes to the internet. People – even kids – should be informed appropriately so they know what they are getting into when they sign up and join websites such as Facebook, MySpace, BuddyPic, etc. I am not calling for a Big Brother or 1984 style government spying on citizens; I am just calling for the citizens to have some common sense and to show some basic logical judgment. If this is too much to ask for any specific person, then that person should not be allowed to even use a powerful tool such as a computer. In some senses, one could argue that a computer with access to the internet can be more powerful and destructive than a car – ask anyone who has had their identity stolen or bank funds drained. A license to use the internet may sound extreme, but I think it would not be completely illogical. As a closing note, I would like to say that I myself am part of Facebook and MySpace. I do not use these websites for any other purpose then to keep in touch with friends that I know in real life. I have never and would never write or hold conversations on these utilities that I wouldn’t say loudly in a crowded room of strangers. Then again, I believe I have common sense.'},\n",

I do, however, completely understand the reasoning that some people would have who would be opposed to this change. But for those who would say something along the lines of the following, I disagree: “The Catholic Church should not need to change its ways to adapt. What is happening is that people are just drifting further away from the Church. Yes, the world is changing, but that just means that we need to hold stronger to the truths and ways of the Church.” I disagree with the above reasoning because I believe that many of the “laws” of the Catholic Church were made merely by humans who were looking to further the Catholic Church politically, not to enhance the spiritual lives of its followers. For example, if you look at the example of not eating before receiving Holy Communion, you see that this rule has change over the years. A couple of decades ago, pre-Vatican II, you were not allowed to eat anything from around late Saturday night until after church on Sunday morning so that your body would be empty and ready to receive the body of Christ. Now, that rule has been changed to be that you should refrain from eating approximately one hour before receiving communion. Who came up with either of these “rules” and who changed them? Humans. I do not feel that I am lacking spiritually because I can eat closer to the time of communion than, say, my parents, who when they were younger had to follow the earlier rule. Many trivial rules such as this deter people who were raised as Catholics but not choose not to practice their religion. From my personal experience, and from talking to other people, I get the impression that with all of the rules and regulations, many people adopt an “all or nothing” approach; if they don’t feel that they can play by all of the rules, then they figure why bother. Because of this, I feel that the Catholic Church is losing members. Many people are raised Catholic, but do not actively participate in the Church once they get to the age where their parents no longer force them to attend mass. I believe that if some of the rules were adapted to the 21st century, then maybe more people would play an active role in the Church and truly practice the Catholic faith. Regarding the issue of allowing priests to marry, I think that they should be allowed. As a member of the congregation, it is sometimes difficult to connect with the priest because he leads a life that is so different from your own. Were priests allowed to marry, they would have much more in common with their parishioners and could better reach them spiritually as a result. I think that if priests were allowed to marry, this might prevent some of the instances of pedophilia. I think that in many cases, some of the men who are priests today became priests during an era when homosexuality was not as openly accepted as it is today. If they did not want to marry, another option for men was to become a priest, because this avoided the question of why you were not getting married. However, some of these men had built-up sexual tension, which they took out inappropriately on children of the church.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong?',\n",
       "   'output': 'Some states have legalized gay marriage, but other states have not. This issue is a big one in the United States. I do not real feel that either side is right or wrong. This issue is one which is so personal, that I can not really determine how I feel about it. At the risk of sounding self-centered, I will say this anyway: since I am not homosexual, this issue has not really been one that is in the forefront of my mind. I am not going to be directly affected by laws which legalize or ban gay marriage. To me, it doesn’t really make much of a difference whether or not gay marriage is legalized. If homosexual couples want to enter into a legal bound relationship such as marriage, just as heterosexual couples do, then I can’t really see that it is right to prevent this from happening. Who are we to tell two people who are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together that they are not allowed to get married? On the other hand, marriage is traditionally thought of as a sacred bond between a man and a woman. To help decipher how I feel about gay marriage, I will first go to the root – the idea of marriage itself. In this day and age, when it is becoming more common for couples to live together and to raise families without ever getting married, we must ask why people get married. If you can live together and have a family without being married, then why do it? My answer is that when you marry someone, regardless of all of the legal aspects of marriage, you are saying that you love that person so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with them. You make a vow that through good and bad, you will stay together “until death do us part.” These are pretty powerful ideas. So if two people really are this much in love and really to want to commit themselves to this sort of a bond, then they should be permitted to, whether or not they are heterosexual or homosexual. Now, all of that said, I still can’t quite shake my old-fashioned ideas about marriage being an act meant for a man and a woman. Also, although I stated earlier that it is possible to live together and to have children without being married, I feel that if you love someone enough to start a family with them, then for the sake of the children, you should get married. If you are not planning on staying in a committed relationship with your partner, then you should probably not have children. As far as whether or not the federal government should be involved in this issue, I feel that we, as a country, should at least be united on the question of the legalization of or banning of gay marriage. While I do not really feel very strongly one way or another (I am not necessarily a supporter of gay marriage, but I can’t say that I am “offended” by it, or really strongly oppose it either), I do believe that whatever decision is made, should be true throughout the whole country.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began. How do you feel about the war?',\n",
       "   'output': 'The war in Iraq is certainly a very controversial issue indeed. Honestly, I am not even sure exactly how I feel about it. I do not believe that I know enough about the current situation or about the whole history of the situation to truly make a decision. I would like to be more knowledgeable about current events such as this, but I don’t watch the news or read newspapers enough. One thing that I do feel about the war is that I would like it to end as soon as possible. I would like our troops home and safe. Too many innocent lives have been lost already. I am, however, very supportive of our soldiers. I also feel that since the United States intervened in Iraq and basically eliminated whatever political structure existed in Iraq, it is up to us to finish what we started. It would not be fair for us to go in, knock out whatever form of government existed (no matter how tyrannical or harsh it was) and then just leave the Iraqi people to clean up the mess that we made. So while I would like for our troops to be able to come home soon, I do see the need for us to remain to keep peace while the new democratic government gets on its feet. I just don’t want us to stay longer than is necessary. This war has gone on long enough. As far as the start of the war goes, I am not sure if I feel that we should have gone there in the first place. After the events of September 11th, I could definitely see the reasoning and the logic behind the war in Afghanistan: our nation was terrorized and attacked and we wanted to find the people responsible for that. It would have been very odd if we had not done something in response to the attack on September 11th. However, the war in Iraq is not directly related to September 11th. After the terrorist attacks, naturally our country was on the watch for anything that might pose a threat to our safety. Security everywhere was heightened. When news came out that Saddam Hussein might have weapons of mass destruction, obviously we were very concerned. We did not just want to stand by and wait until these weapons could possibly be used against our country. On the other hand, we wanted to exercise diplomatic ways of going about it first, before just starting a war. But Iraq would not allow the United Nations officials to search the country for the weapons. This made us even more nervous. We didn’t want to wait. We tried to get approval before just going in, but this led to the whole issue with France. This is where I am confused on whether or not it was the right decision to wage war on Iraq without the consent of the United Nations. This is also where many anti-Bush people bring up the issue of oil, stating the Bush just wanted to get oil and that that was the primary motivation for going into Iraq. What I can think of, is that if we had not gone into Iraq and it turned out that they did have weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein sold to terrorist organizations which then attacked us, we would be very sorry and would be wishing that we had done something as a preventative measure. It just seems like a huge shame that so many lives have been lost along the way.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an email response to a someone who asked you the following: The controversial war in Iraq has made news headlines almost every day since it began. How do you feel about the war?',\n",
       "   'output': \"I am ashamed to say that I know very little about the situation with the war in Iraq. I don't really follow politics that much and am not very in tune with what the current situation is. My thoughts on this topic will have to relate more to the events of Septemeber 11th and how that lead to the war in Iraq. After our nation was attacked, and we started the war in Afghanistan, I felt that that war was justified (or at least justified as much as you can justify war, which is a whole other issue). The facts were that we were attacked and we were waging war in Afghanistan in an effort to find the people responsbible for attacking us. It would have been very strange for us NOT to have had some sort of a response to such a major attack. However, it gets somewhat more tricky when we move to talking about the war in Afghanistan to the war in Iraq. I will try to explain my views as best as possible. After the events of September 11th, we were really on the watch about other possible terrorist attacks or attacks of any other kind on the United States. So when ideas surfaced that Saddam Hussein might have biological weapons in Iraq, naturally our attention was aroused. However, with the whole issue of Saddam not allowing United Nations officials to search Iraq, the issue became even trickier. We were very nervous that Iraq was lying and the fact that they refused to let UN officials search made us even more suspicious. So naturally,we wanted to find out for sure. But we did not have permission from the UN to wage war. I think that one of the points of an instituion like the United Nations is to prevent such situations from escalating into war. However (and I am a little unsure about the chain of events that took place here) I think that what happened was that time was starting to run out. It was taking so long to gain approval from the UN and it began to look like we wouldn't get the approval after all. Then, we were afraid that if there really were weapons of mass destruction that Iraq was hiding, we could be setting up our country for disaster if we did not do something about it. So we have on our hands a very difficult decision. I know that this is the point where many people bring up the issue of oil and say that Bush only wanted to go into Iraq to get oil. But we ARE in Iraq now and have we really gotten oil out of the situation?? Anyway, think of what would have happened if we had NOT gone into Iraq, and then it turned out that Saddam had weapons that he then used on the United States. Imagine if we had not done anything about it and had just sat back waiting to be attacked? Now, the situation over in Iraq is difficult as well. By going in and removing whatever form of leadership and government existed, we have completely taken away any form of a political structure. The citizens of Iraq were living under horrible conditions, so in many ways, we are making their lives better. But now, it is a big mess over there. I think that it is up to us, since we were the ones that went in an took out their political stucture, to stay there to finish out what we have started. We started the mess by going into Iraq in the first place, so it is thus our responsibility to finish it and make sure that everything gets cleaned up. At the same time though, enough American lives have been lost already and I would hope to see more troops coming home and the United States finishing up its business in Iraq as soon as possible.\"},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin. Do you think this was an invasion of privacy?',\n",
       "   'output': 'I think that is it good that school officials were able to prevent a school shooting, regardless of how they came about this information. Which issue is more important: the death of a student, or the fact that a student’s privacy might have been violated? In my opinion, there is a clear cut answer: the student’s life is much more important. Frankly, I don’t even really see this as an invasion of privacy, since the information was posted on the Internet. The information on the Internet is available for millions of people to see and when you post anything online, you need to be aware of this fact. Even though I am glad that the school official saw the bulletin on myspace since it saved a student’s life, we can still ask the question of whether or not this was an invasion of privacy. To do so, we must know how the school official came across the information. While I do not have a myspace profile myself, I know that myspace has certain privacy controls. One of the settings is that you must grant someone permission to see your profile. If this student had this setting on, then in order for the school official to have read the posting, the student must have granted the school official access to his or her profile. If this was the case, then it was not an invasion of privacy, since the student gave permission. If the student did not have this setting on, then he or she must be aware that anyone who has access to the Internet also potentially has access to view the information that is posted in his or her myspace profile. If this was the case, then I still do not see this as an invasion of privacy, since the student posted information that is visible to everyone. When ever you post any information on the Internet, you must realize that virtually anyone has access to this information. Thus, it is up to you to monitor what you post. If there is something that you do not want everyone to see, then you must be responsible and sensor what you post. Think twice before putting anything on the Internet, because you never know who will be reading it. Now, all of that said, I will admit that it is a little weird and we must question why the school official was looking at the student’s myspace profile. (I am happy that he or she was looking at it since it prevented possible loss of lives, but I will admit that it is kind of strange.) Was the school official just randomly on the Internet and just happened to see this bulletin? I highly doubt it. What is more likely is that this student was suspected of being up to something or was profiled as a troubled kid. The school official was most likely intentionally looking at this student’s profile in an effort to come up with more information. It is hard to say where to draw the line here. On the one hand, you might say that a school official should not be sitting around snooping through students’ myspace profiles. But I still can’t get over the fact that had this school official not done this, innocent lives might have been lost. And to me, it is more important that lives are saved, than that we protect the privacy of teenagers.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"I do not think that marijuana should be legalized. I don't really have a good reason why, but I just don't like the idea of the government legalizing a way for people to get high. I think that it is particularly strange that just one city, Denver, has legalized marijuana. This makes things even trickier. For example, it just seems weird to me that you would be allowed to smoke in Denver, but not in the next town over. It's not even that marijuana is legal in the state of Colorado, but only in one city. That is just weird to me. And how can we be sure that we are keeping this under control? How can the government regulate whether or not the marijuana is really being brought to Denver. Let's say there is some shipment or something that was coming from Mexico and was headed for Denver. What's to say that the marijuana isn't going to be brought elsewhere? Like how can you guarantee that it will wind up in Denver. On the other hand, when everyone goes to Denver to legally purchase marijuana, there is no guarantee that they will smoke it in Denver and not just bring it back to wherever they came from (where it is illegal). We already face this sort of an issue with fireworks. They are allowed in some states, but not in others. So people just go across the border and legally purchase fireworks. It is so hard to regulate though, so people bring them back to states where it is not allowed. We are talking about a similar situation here, but instead of talking about fireworks, we are discussing a drug which affects how a person acts and behaves. Drunk driving is already a huge issue in our country. Sure, it is illegal to drive while intoxicated, but people do it all the time and lives are lost as a result. Even though marijuana is not legal in the United States now, it doesn't mean that people don't smoke. But why would we want to make it legal to purchase a drug which would just mean that more people could be on the roads under the influence. I have never smoked myself, and so I am not sure exactly what the effects of marijuana are on a person but I would say that they are probably rather similar to the effects of alcohol. So I would not want to have more people who are high driving around and going to work, etc. It just doesn't seem right to me to make it legal to add another harmful drug to your body.\"},\n",

       "   'output': 'The war in Iraq is arguably the central focus of the United States’ foreign policy. The government is expending many resources, including large sums of money and thousands of troops, for the sake of winning the Iraqi war. The fact that the US is involved in this war influences the life of every single US citizen, and naturally, has been a cause of contention. A person’s views on the war in Iraq can quickly associate him or her with a political party, because the war is so critical to American politics. The war in Iraq is a major focus of American attention, and opinions on the United States’ role in it vary widely. I feel that the United States is not making enough headway in its mission to continue the war in Iraq. The majority of this problem stems from the fact that the United States’ mission in Iraq is unclearly defined. It is easy to suggest possible goals, but the government has not done a good job of explicitly identifying the nation’s purpose in Iraq. Daily, citizens like me wonder why the US government is so adamant about maintaining occupation of Iraq. What is the government hoping to gain and accomplish? If the American people had a clear, justified answer to this question, it would be much easier to support the war effort. As it is, however, I cannot help but be opposed to something whose motive is so disguised. Without a clear sense of the war’s purpose, the war just seems destructively harmful and excessive. The United States puts so many resources into the war, and seems really invested in their cause, whatever it may be exactly. Without knowing this cause, it seems wasteful to expend resources in such a manner, and even worse, to think of the lives that are being adversely affected because of the Iraqi war. American soldiers are constantly being sent out to serve in Iraq, and many of them do not make it home alive. Others return injured, or at the very best, physically healthy but having had endured the awful tragedy of war and destruction. War undoubtedly takes a toll on the American people, not to mention on the Iraqi people. Destruction and death are common problems in a nation at war, especially when the war is fought on the nation’s home territory, as is the case for the Iraqi people. The presence of United States’ forces in Iraq only worsens the quality of life for the Iraqi people, to the point where they are living in constant fear of death and endangerment. The detriments of the war in Iraq, for the US itself and for the Iraqi people are hard to justify without a clearly defined role and purpose of the United States in the war. For this reason, the best course of action is to end the action in Iraq, for the war has gone on long enough, and it is time to replace destruction and death with peace and well-being.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Gender discrimination is more commonly associated with the past, when peoples roles in life were defined by their gender. Nowadays, it easier for women to hold professional positions, and there are men who run their households. That is not to say, however, that the problem of gender discrimination has been eliminated. While it is possible for people today to break through the boundaries imposed by gender discrimination, those boundaries still exist in a very real way. Stereotypical gender roles are still prevalent, and women are often discriminated against in the workplace and in traditionally male settings. There is also a less significant issue of men being discriminated against in traditionally female roles. Overall, a lot of gender discrimination still exists in the present-day United States, to which there is no simple solution. Solving the problem of gender discrimination is no easy task. It will of course take much to time to completely even out the expectations for males and females, and it may not even be achievable given the United States’ past history of unequal gender roles. The best thing to do is to encourage men and women who take on positions and tasks typically designated for the opposite sex. Only with widespread acceptance of such actions will they become the norm, which is necessary to eliminate gender discrimination. It is important to try to separate a role from a gender, so that it becomes accepted for any role to be played by any individual regardless of gender, which is what it means to be free of gender discrimination. There is a long way to go to solve the problem of gender discrimination, but hopefully the conscious efforts that people make to accept untraditional roles will contribute to the elimination of such a negative force that shapes society.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Privacy is a right that many people in America feel belongs to them. Unfortunately, the Bill of Rights has no provision for a right to privacy. Privacy is something that many American citizens assume belongs to them, but in fact, privacy is not protected under the law, and is not considered a fundamental right in the Bill of Rights. While it may be unethical to invade privacy in some situations, there are certain cases in which invasion of privacy is necessary to maintain the safety and security of American citizens. In matters of national security, it is perfectly acceptable to invade privacy to explore a potential threat to the people of the American nation. There is much debate over what is an acceptable invasion of privacy and what is not. Any invasion of privacy for the purpose of exploring a possibly subversive act is acceptable because it is done with good intent, for the well-being of people. Invasions of privacy that do not involve a serious matter should not go on. It is unethical to invade a person’s privacy without good reason, and the only good reason is if that person is suspected to be hiding something that could possibly harm others. Privacy is a courtesy that others should be afforded when possible, but it is perfectly fine to invade it when necessary for the protection of others. Without necessary invasions of property, it is possible for things to go awry and for major consequences to result. Serious damage can be caused by threats that go unchecked and blossom into events that endanger human lives and prosperity. Every day, countless subversive acts are prevented, thanks to the people who work in the field of national security. Much of this national security work involves recording phone conversations, tracking emails, and investigating suspicious activity, any of which could be construed as an invasion of privacy. Without these invasions of privacy, however, our nation would be subject to extremist plots and harmful attacks. It is far better to invade some people’s privacy than to risk the safety and well-being of an entire nation. Those who wish to maintain privacy rights unconditionally need to realize that their request comes at a cost of human lives.'},\n",

If the American government suspects potential harm, it has the power to invade the privacy of American citizens in the interest of doing what is best for the nation and the American people as a whole. National security can only be acheived through invading privacy because subversive acts are naturally kept private. No one would advertise their involvement in a harmful or malicious act, because of the consequences that could result. In order to uncover these acts before they happen, therefore, it is necessary to invade privacy and investigate suspicious activity. If the government has reason to believe that someone is hiding something which could be dangerous to the US or to other people, the government has a duty to protect its citizens by investigating the hidden activity. Of course, no government is justified in invading privacy without cause, but wherever suspicious activity is present or believed to exist, it is absolutely acceptable for the government to intervene, invading privacy if necessary to uphold safety and security.

       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong?',\n",
       "   'output': 'The right to marry whoever one pleases is no more outrageous than freedom of speech, or the right to a fair trial, which are granted freely in the Bill of Rights. Since the right to marry whoever one pleases is not explicitly stated as an American’s right, many people try to deny its existence. In many cases, there is no controversy surrounding who a person chooses to marry. When a woman chooses a man to spend her life with, she will meet no opposition from the government or political activists. The same is true for a man who chooses a woman to marry. When a woman chooses woman, however, or a man a man, the controversy surrounding the issue of marriage becomes much more pronounced. All of a sudden, the union of two people which we call marriage is not as easily accepted by society. Only in cases of homosexual marriages does the government wish to have a say in who can marry who. This is not a proper place for the government to be in control, because it only becomes involved when it deems a marriage problematic, that is, when it is between two people of the same sex. Not only should the government step down from the issue of gay marriage, but the American people need to learn to be more tolerant of others. Two of the main problems that people have with gay marriage are that they think it is contrary to the Bible, or it seems something they themselves would never want to participate in. For those who oppose gay marriage because the Bible describes marriage in a traditional male-female sense, they need to remember that the Bible is to be interpreted, not read as law. It is impossible to follow every facet of Biblical teaching, and as long as a gay marriage follows the rules of respect and exchange detailed in the Bible, then it is not contrary to Biblical teachings, just a different scriptural interpretation. For those who oppose gay marriage because they themselves have no interest in ever being married to a person of the same sex, they need to learn that what is right for one person may be wrong for another. Everybody is different and it is important to embrace these differences instead of forcing conformity to a set of rules that does not work for everyone. Flexibility is the best way to please all. Choosing who to spend the rest of one’s life with is a big commitment, and anyone who decides to join themselves in the union of marriage to another human being should be allowed to do so legally by marriage. People should be more tolerant and accepting of others, and realize that gay marriage is not hurting anyone, but only making people happy by giving them the opportunity to spend their lives with the people they love, united as one through the ritual of marriage. There is really no reason to be opposed to people’s happiness, and therefore, no reason to be opposed to gay marriage, as for many people, happiness can be found through the possibility of gay marriage.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'There is much controversy surrounding the issue of the legalization of marijuana. The drug is known to have medicinal benefits, and it is legal in many other countries. At the same time, it also leads users towards more harmful drugs. Clearly, marijuana is illegal for a reason, and any decision to legalize it would be unwise and would endanger the health and safety of many people. The current state, in which marijuana is illegal, is ideal and should be upheld firmly. Marijuana is commonly known as the gateway drug. Many users begin drug use with marijuana, and go on to use more harmful drugs, such as heroin or ecstasy. Marijuana is a mind and personality altering drug, with short term as well as long term effects, few of which can be deemed positive. It is not only easy to transition from marijuana to more serious drugs, but it is easy to become addicted. Drug addiction is nothing to be taken lightly, and legalizing marijuana, even in small quantities, would only add to this problem. It is ambiguous to legalize “small amount of marijuana” and also probably very difficult to enforce. It is much simpler and safer to keep marijuana illegal and not forget its mind-altering qualities and unpleasant behaviors associated with its use. Despite the clearly negative effects of marijuana use, many people wish to legalize it either for its medicinal benefits or because its effects seem similar to those of alcohol. To those who claim that the health benefits outweigh the detriments, their argument might be worthy were it not for the addictive nature of marijuana. A small dose of marijuana might be helpful in treating certain medical conditions, but such a treatment would also place the patient within the grasp of a lifelong substance addiction. Depending on the necessity and frequency of marijuana treatments, patients could theoretically wind up cured of an ailment, but ripe for the development of an even more serious drug problem. It is far better to use other treatments and keep the number of people with drug problems down to the bare minimum. The effects of marijuana may seem no more severe than those of alcohol that it should be an illegal substance while alcohol is legal. The effects of marijuana, however, are significantly more serious than those of alcohol. The main reason for this is again, that marijuana is the gateway drug. Alcohol use can lead to alcoholism, an addiction to one particular substance, but marijuana use can often lead to a myriad of drug addiction problems. Society is familiar with the abusive relationships that can result from alcoholism, and it would not be wise to increase the amount of poor behavior by creating more people who are dependent upon a substance. It is important that the serious effects of marijuana use not be downplayed in an attempt to justify its legalization. Overall, marijuana use had many problems associated with it that would only escalate if the drug became more prominent through its legalization. The best policy regarding marijuana is to maintain the current no tolerance policy for this harmful drug, rather than try to find reasons justifying its legalization.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'As a member of the Catholic Church, I do not feel that the church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st century. I disagree with the cases of pedophilia and agree that they do need to be addressed and dealt with. I do not think that these cases could have been prevented if the church changed or adapted its ways to the 21s century. To begin, I have been a member of my church since I was born. I went to a private grammar and private high school, both with churches on the property. There would be days that we would dress in our church attire and miss class to attend mass. From the 4th grade to the 12th grade (up until I came to Loyola) I was a member of my parish’s chorus. I was also a lector at the teenage mass on Sundays. Holidays were always a big deal in my family; our holiday dinners and gatherings would be planned around what mass we were going to. I would buy a new outfit to wear for Christmas and Easter, just so I look nice at mass. This is the church I know, I do not need it to change; I like it the way it is. I do not think the church should change because it was created this way and should stay the way it was created to be. I think that the 21st century has destroyed the image of the church and the mass. For my parish in particular, people no longer get “dressed up”, but sometimes come in their “beach” attire after a morning under the sun. People even walk into mass 20 minutes late-I just don’t see the point. People seem to have lost their respect for the sanctity of the church. I do not think that the cases of pedophilia could have been prevented. The church could not have known that these people would turn out to do such horrible things. If they did, then they were very wrong in trying to hide this information. I have no sympathy for any of these men that took advantage of boys using their power and situation. I do not believe that priests should be allowed to marry nor should women be able to become priests. These ideas were not involved in the early days of the church-it would just be weird if it were to change. Like the example I gave in the emails with the show “7th Heaven”, seeing Lucy as a reverend seems strange to me. I am accustomed to seeing males as the priest or reverend figure. This may sound old fashion, I am 18 and not old fashion, but concerning the church, I like the things they way they are. If I were immediately affected by the scandals in the church I do not think that my opinion would be any different. I do not think allowing women to become priests would have made a difference; women are just as capable as committing these acts, as are men. And the question for whether a priest should be allowed to get married, well married men have committed acts of pedophilia also. The church has changed its ways, it has become more lenient, it has adapted.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Another controversial issue is the legalization of marijuana. Marijuana seems to entice many people when they just want to “chill out”. Marijuana has been studied for years with scientific findings that prove that marijuana does not have positive effects on individuals. I do not think that most people truly know the side effects of marijuana and therefore feel that this is the drug, if any, to abuse. I believe that the city of Denver has made a mistake in legalizing small amounts of marijuana for people over the age of 21. Now, just like with alcohol, 21 year olds can buy for underage individuals. An underage individual does not even necessarily need a 21 year old; they just need his or her ID. I do not agree with the city of Denver and their decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana. In my email portion of this study, my response was different from what it is now because in between the time, I learned more about the effects of marijuana and what it is doing to a persons body. Personally, I do not feel that marijuana provides any great feeling; I do not think it is that great to risk killing brain cells, or to risk damaging ones lungs. My grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer almost one year ago. The doctors told him that he had two years to live. He smoked almost ever day of his adult life, cigarettes in the early years and then cigars in the later years. My grandfather was not smoking marijuana, he was smoking tobacco-there is no difference because they produce similar results. I went to visit my grandfather last weekend; he lies in a bed, it hurts to sit up in a chair, he can not move on his own, he needs two nurses to help him go to the bathroom. The cancer moved from his lungs to his bones; he fell a few times, first breaking his left arm and then his hip. My grandfather is 75 years young and was told that he had seven to ten months to live. I do not know what it would feel like to know this. I would probably wonder why this had to happen. My grandfather can not go home in his final months of life; he was placed in a nursing home on Thanksgiving Day. My grandmother can not take care of him on her own- she says all she can do is pray for him. With my grandfather in mind and the memory of him I do not agree with the legalization of marijuana. I do not feel that marijuana should be legal, but I feel that marijuana’s effects are not as great as alcohol. I do not want alcohol to be illegal, but I feel that it is more lethal then marijuana. Many people abuse alcohol; they believe they can become a different person when under the influence. All alcohol does is make one lose their inhibitions and place one in a situation that they will most likely regret the next day. Marijuana can be used without making a person totally incapable of functioning. I have seen more people pass out or “black out” from alcohol then from marijuana. I have also seen that more people drive when under the influence of marijuana, rather then alcohol, showing that people feel the same or close to the same. Most would not risk getting into a car with a drunk driver, hopefully they would not let a drunk driver in the car seat, but many would not think twice about getting in the car with someone who was high. People are going to make their own choices about the matter of marijuana whether it is legal or not. I believe that Denver took a step in the wrong direction and hopefully other states do not follow in their footsteps.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The war in Iraq has been a major issue since the time I was in the 8th grade, after the collapse and attack on the World Trade Center. When I first heard about the incident, I didn’t know that it was a terror attack nor did I know what the World Trade Center was. All I knew was that something happened in the city, and kids were being taken out of school early. I arrived home and the attack was all over the news. I kept seeing the word “war” on the screen; it made me nervous. I had studied about wars in school and thought to myself how lucky we were to not be in a war and how lucky I was to never have had to experience a war. All of a sudden, we were in a war. This kind of war seemed scarier to me though. It was a war not being fought on our battlefields between men who hopefully wanted to be there, but a war on innocent individuals who could not have seen it coming. On September 10th, I had travel basketball try-outs with my coach from the previous year, Coach Farrell. Mr. Lynch was Katie’s father, a girl that I had been in school with since kindergarten; we weren’t close friends, but we played sports together. The first try out had ended and he gathered us all around him. I do not remember exactly what he said to us, I can still remember his smile and how happy he was to see us all back on the basketball court. He had a way of encouraging us to do our best, he never made us feel that we could not succeed; he was stern, but never mean. It never mattered if we lost as long as we did our best. Mr. Lynch was a great man who loved his family, his friends, and teaching others a game that he had loved as a child. I may not remember what he said to us after practice, but as we were leaving he said, “See you tomorrow girls!” That was the last time I would ever see Mr. Lynch. His office was located in one of the World Trade Center buildings. They had found an intact check he had written that morning among the rubble; the Lynch family has that check. I do not remember seeing Katie that day, I remember her mother speaking at his funeral, telling us that Farrell lived a good life and would not want us to dwell on his death, but to move on. Mrs. Lynch brought a note card that he had left for her on her dresser before he left for a business trip one week. She read the note card and began to cry. Mrs. Lynch was a strong woman but not that strong. There were 22 people in my parish that had died from the collapse of the towers. These 22 people all left behind families and children. Mr. Lynch’s brother had also died in this tragedy. Because of this memory, I do not feel that the war has gone on long enough. I believe that our troops are doing a good job in Iraq, and we should be commending them, we should be supporting them, we should not be questioning whether we want them home or not. They are protecting the thousands of innocent people, like Mr. Lynch, who died for no good reason. Why that day? Why those people? Why those buildings? I think that war is an awful thing. I wish mankind was more peaceful and never had to go to war, but that is a dream and will never be. So for now, let’s pray for our troops and pray for each other that nothing like this will ever happen again.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Once again, we come to an issue that many people have strong feelings on. In my previous response through the email, I believe that I had a different opinion from the one that I have now. Gay marriage is an issue that should have a 100% overall agreement. I do not believe either side is wrong in their beliefs. We are in the 20th century- times have changed and people should be more accepting of the changes in sexuality. As for President Bush’s push for an amendment to ban gay marriage, I do not agree. Studies may differ, but with others knowledge and with the information presented to me, I feel that genetics is the cause for a person to be homosexual and not heterosexual. I do not feel that it is due to a person’s environment, or they way they were brought up. This type of sexuality has existed all the way back to the time of our creation. It has always been there, people just decided to avoid the subject. I do not agree with the federal government trying to intervene in a person’s private life, especially if they are trying to decide who an individual can marry- it is ridiculous to even think about! Marriage was created to bring together a man and a woman; rules have been bent for other issues less important than gay marriage. Why are people so afraid of this change? I know I am uneasy of the idea, but I have to accept it, because we can not change a person’s genetics or who they are attracted to. The ancient philosopher Plato, described humans as beings searching for their other half. He described the original humans as beings in the shape of a ball with two pairs of sexual organs. One ball had two male organs, one ball had two female organs, and the other ball had one male organ and one female organ. When the gods feared the power of humans, Zeus split them in half; they wandered the world searching for their other half. This is how love is described, the search for our soul mate, and the search for the deep connection that we cannot describe. The side opposing gay marriage is not wrong, they believe they are acting for the good of the people, but how do they know what is good for these people different from them. The federal government is not needed for this issue; they have greater things to worry about, and marriage is not one of them.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin. Do you think this was an invasion of privacy?',\n",
       "   'output': 'Currently, the issue of privacy has become a hot topic among people; there is one side that believes our privacy rights are being infringed upon, there are those that feel that we are being protected, and there are some that are not affected either way. In the issue of privacy concerning posts on myspace.com, I do not believe that the individual’s privacy rights were infringed upon. To begin, the internet is not somewhere to post something an individual wants to keep private. The internet connects every person in the whole world; everyone has access to the internet twenty-four hours a day. The individual that posted a bulletin knew that other people would see this post. The individual may not have known that school officials would be looking, but it was there for the public. The school officials were looking out for the best interest of the school as a community. I believe that school officials should keep an eye on such “live posts” or “blogs” that appear on the internet. There are some people that cannot express themselves well, and will write something online that could indicate a problem of theirs. I would not call this incident an invasion of privacy. I would call this incident lucky, because the officials were able to prevent a tragic event that has affected many schools across the United States. I would consider something like this an invasion of privacy if it did not affect the school community. I do not believe that school officials should be intruding on the lives of their students. But students do have to realize that the internet is public- what they post can be seen by anyone; teachers, faculty, and school officials. My high school principle had a “myspace” page with plenty of students as his friends. Of course my principle had access to all of the student’s pictures, but he did not get a student in trouble for what he saw. The faculty heard stories in the hallways, they picked up notes, they saw pictures that were dropped, and they only intruded when necessary. The necessary was not most of the time. An invasion of privacy cannot be considered an actual invasion if it is in the best interest of the people. I know that many people would disagree with this statement, especially with all the new practices since September 11th.

       " 9: [{'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this?',\n",
       "   'output': 'When it comes to the legalization of marijuana, I have long felt and continue to feel that there is really no reason to continue this useless war against the drug. Most of the anti-marijuana campaigns I have witnessed have few to no facts backing their claims and are more aimed at using emotional impact or bandwagon propaganda techniques in order to convince their viewers that smoking marijuana is an evil. The latest anti-marijuana commercial I have seen is just a girl and her dog, and the dog complains to the girl that she’s not the same when she smokes. This is perhaps the most ridiculous commercial I have ever seen. Without a single fact or figure in the entire commercial, are we supposed to be moved by a talking dog? A little critical thinking about this might provoke the idea that the reason commercials avoid using concrete evidence is because there isn’t any. When the facts are really examined, this becomes more and more evident. As far as long term effects go, there is little scientific proof linking marijuana with later health problems such as cancer, in fact the good marijuana does by healing patients of glaucoma and alleviating the symptoms of other diseases seems to contradict the evils of long term effects. Besides, do long term effects really hold any say in today’s economy? The evils of the tobacco and food industries do more harm than marijuana could ever do. So it must be the short term effects that the anti-marijuana advocates have such a problem with. However, how are the effects of marijuana any more severe than those of alcohol? When taken in moderation, neither drug is particularly harmful. When taken responsibly, neither one is a real danger. However, when abused and taken in excess, the effects of marijuana are far less severe than alcohol. An “overdose” of alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning, blacking out, or ultimately death. However, it is physically impossible to smoke enough to weed to overdose. Besides, there’s a definite point where one really can’t smoke anymore. In fact, there’s never been a documented death due to marijuana overdose. The closest hospital trips due solely to marijuana are for dehydration, which shouldn’t even be a problem when the drug is taken responsibly. So all that is left to examine really is the side effects of the drug, or rather everything surrounding the use of the drug, from what one might do while intoxicated, to the burgeoning drug culture surrounding marijuana. As for actions taken while intoxicated, this is 100% correlated with the responsibility of the user. If an intoxicated person decides to drive, this is no worse than drinking and driving, if not better. But it is also still 100% the user’s decision to drive. Sure, marijuana might impair one’s judgment, but it does not impair one’s sense of social responsibility. If one decides to drive while intoxicated, they probably are missing the sense of responsibility not to drive intoxicated in the first place. It is not the drug’s fault, but the fault of the driver. This is why keeping the substance controlled and sold in moderation is a good idea. It keeps the supply in the hands of legitimate business and out of the pockets of drug dealers, and while this may make the drug more easily available to those underage, it will effectively make the drug safer for use, limit the quantity available, and remove some of the mystique surrounding an illegal drug. In effect, legalizing the drug will provoke users to be more responsible with it, as shown in cases in Europe, where the drug is legal in certain countries.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"Privacy rights is a topic that is very difficult to discuss in that it is very hard to draw a line as to what exactly constitutes private behavior and what constitutes public behavior. Therefore, with the myspace example, and with internet use in general, it is very hard to pick one side. From what I understand about myspace, most everything a person posts is viewable by anybody who logs onto the service. Actually, i'm not sure you even have to log on. I think you can just search for a person and view their information. Which leads me to believe that was in fact, not an invasion of privacy at all. It all has to do with intent. To look at the most basic form of privacy, the form innate to all humans, is the privacy of our thoughts. While uncountable thoughts run through our heads each day, we have the choice as to which thoughts we want to keep to ourselves and which thoughts we want to vocalize, or make public, for everyone to hear. It is this choice, I believe, that determines whether or not our actions are deemed as public or private. If this student's intent was for nobody to see the things he wrote, he should have posted somewhere where people couldn't see them, perhaps on his computer somewhere just in a word document, or in a diary, or some other private form. If he wanted several people to see what he wrote, but not certain other people, there are other options for doign this. However, posting on myspace, where anyone who wants to read it can, is akin to running out in the middle of the street, screaming that you want to kill people. Everyone has weird thoughts. Everyone, I'm sure, has had at least for one moment, thought about something that they would never ever want to share with anyone. There's nothing wrong with that. If you want to write it down, go ahead and write it down somewhere. But don't post it. Don't let other people see it, unless you want them to. But if you put yourself in a situation where other people can freely see what you've written, without any devious means, then don't complain that they're invading your privacy, because it's your fault.\"},\n",

       "   'output': 'This essay hopefully marks the last time I will ever need to argue about the War in Iraq. Fortunately for me, everybody is beginning to agree with the point of view I have had since the start of the war. Of course, this is unfortunate for our country, because if we had a legitimate reason for entering the country, and were fighting a just war, then we wouldn’t be the bad guys. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a legitimate reason, and this war isn’t just. Why did we enter in the first place? I think the reasons the Bush administration have given: weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, Saddam as a threat to the world, have all been effectively ruled out. Then what could it have been? Oil? Money? Revenge? It doesn’t really matter now. Most of the world knows we were wrong, and most of the United States has accepted that, except unfortunately for the current administration, who of course are stubborn and stuck on staying in the country that we have no place being in. Of course I feel like a hypocrite talking about the war, not ever having been in it, or even close to it. Let me not then talk just of myself. Recent polls have shown that 70% of our soldiers think we need to pull out within the year. 80% of Iraqis think we need to leave, and 2/3 of the world’s population agree. If the people of the country we are trying to ‘help’ don’t want us there, then why in God’s name do we persist? This can’t benefit us, with the number of American soldiers dying. Perhaps a few businessmen and big businesses close to the Bush administration are benefiting, but that doesn’t really seem like a justifiable reason to stay. But perhaps one shouldn’t just look at the negative aspects of our prolonged stay. Maybe should look at all the good that has come from our occupation. For example, look at all those kids growing up who really wanted to kill people and fire guns and all that fun stuff, but were always overwhelmed with a moral responsibility not to do so. Well now all those masochistic oddballs have their chance! It’s not even illegal, and if they do a good enough job, they might get medals and tons of other benefits! This is really a win-win situation, save for of course, the Iraqis they are killing. But they are the enemy of course. Well, except for all the innocent Iraqis they have been torturing and killing, at Haditha and Abu Ghraib and Ishaqi. Oh and there’s that fourteen year old Iraqi girl that was raped and killed while her family was forced to watch. But hey, isn’t it better for all those psychos to get their rage and their evil out on some other country than here in the United States? And here’s another pro: look at it from the point of view of the terrorists. What if after 9/11 the United States would have taken positive steps towards countering terrorism? Then these poor terrorists wouldn’t have stood a chance, with the size of our military and all the nuclear weapons and high grade technology we have. Now, because we’ve entered a country that really has no effect on the war on terror, Al Qaeda has a chance. Recently discovered letters from Al Qaeda leaders actually claim that the longer the United States stays in Iraq, the more powerful Al Qaeda will become. Yay! I’m glad were doing so much to help terrorists. However, some may be of the opinion that fostering terrorist organizations may be taking toleration a little too far. I’ll leave that up to personal opinion, though.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"Well first off, let me start off by saying I don't really care at all what the Catholic Church decides to do. I've already decided for myself that religion is not something I'm interested in being a part of, and would rather not hear anything about religion for the rest of my life. That being said, my responses can be put into the context of a nonbeliever. Should the Catholic Church have to change it's ways to adapt to 21st century life? I don't personally know if they need to. What I mean is, Is the Church's popularity waning? I'm not really up to date on the numbers but it seems as if they are still holding strong in Europe and growing exponentially in Africa and Latin America. In the U.S., it's hard for me to say, especially since I go to a Catholic school, where there are Catholics everywhere. If they really are in need of some kind of change, we have to look at the process of change since its conception. I mean, think how many thousands of years it took just to allow laypeople to read the people. I'm pretty sure that took over a millenium. And to allow translations of the bible, and to accept versions of the Bible as valid besides for their precious Vulgate? Also took thousands and thousands of years. However, the main difference between that millenium and this one is that people live outside of religion. What I mean by that is that until the modern era, God was a generally accepted truth. Nobody didn't believe. Today we have barriers set up between believers and the rest of the world. It's much easier to attract people to your religion when everybody already believes. So do I think the Church needs to change? Absolutely. The church is still operating under the idea that the way they worked during the middle ages, the way they worked during the renaissance, still works. And it doesn't. Unfortunately, my advice to the Catholic Church is a little too radical for Catholics to accept. My first piece of advice: Forget the pope. Really. Why is there a pope? Someone thats holier than all of us? Someone thats between us and God? Why do you listen to what he says, holding on to his words so closely? He wasn't chosen by God, he was chosen by men. That should probably tell you something right away. Stop making people think they need a pope to be in contact with God, cuz it's a lie. That's really all the advice I have to give to the Catholic Church. I really don't care what else they do. I'm just tired of the pope.\"},\n",

       "   'output': \"Good question. I absolutely do feel that women are discriminated against in America. In the workplace, at home, everywhere. Here's the kicker though. Do I think this is a problem. Nah. Here's the funny thing about discrimination. What the word really means is the ability to make distinctions, or discernment. And here's the thing, if America is headed in the direction where we can't discern the difference between a male and female, then we are headed towards disaster. Now I'm not saying women don't have a place in this world. I love women. They are very useful for many different things. Really, if there weren't any women, not only would our species come to an end, but I in particular would be a mess. You see, I can't really cook at all, and I don't particularly like cleaning either. I mean, I can clean, if something is really grossing me out, and I could probably learn to cook too, but I really just don't want to. You may say, well Tyler, why don't you just order out, and hire a maid service? Well, I'd say, ordering out does get pretty pricey, and also I don't want cleaning people in my house that I don't know. They're a sneaky people. They'd rob me blind. So that's out of the question. So really, unless I want to live with a very feminine male roommate for the rest of my life, getting married is really the best option. I see that part of the question asks about discrimination in the workplace. I don't really know what that's all about. I don't see what women need to work for. That's what I do. Plus there are plenty of jobs that definitely need women to work: strippers, porn stars, supermodels, actresses, masseuses. That's all I can think of right now. I definitely don't want these jobs to be male specific. Especially not stripper or masseuse. I don't want any guys dancing on poles or rubbing my back. So do I really feel this way, or am I being facetious? I'll let you decide.\"},\n",

       "   'output': 'Participant #14 Essay #5 – Catholic Church Luckily, I have experienced life up until my college life with minimal to no influence from the Catholic Church. My father is a minister in a small denomination of Christianity referred to as the Church of the Brethren, which is a completely different view of Christianity than Catholicism. If I still retained my beliefs in religion or God that I did until about high school, my father’s church is most definitely the church I would stick with. It’s a church that altogether practices much more to the example of Jesus Christ than Catholicism, which seems to me more like charades and motions then actual spirituality. The Church of the Brethren is also historically a peace church and a church that stresses simple living (so that others may “simply live,” as their motto goes), most truly to Jesus’ example. However, over the years I have been more than disillusioned to religion, and hold a different stance denying the need for religion altogether. Personally, I feel that if one does believe in a higher power, one does not need a religion to hold a personal relationship with this higher power, and what is a church then, other than a series of rituals and “incantations” that just denies the ability of humans to individually know and love their God? Surely, the morality of religion is necessary, but that this morality must be explained as rules from a higher power that must be followed in order to ensure our place in a decent afterlife seems unnecessary. However I may view the necessity of religion, while religion is here to stay I don’t view it as an evil at all. In fact, I think that for a majority of people, religion has been helpful and I don’t feel the need at all to abolish it. While I might not like the concept, I am entirely open to letting whoever wants to try religion out for size a fair chance. Toleration and freedom of religion are very important to me, and just as I allow homosexuals, women and minorities the same rights, I allow freedom of religion. Now while all the may seem like a tangential dissertation on religion in general and not entirely related to the question, this is my very point. Do I think the Catholic Church needs to change? Absolutely not. If the church changed the opinions it has held for the last couple thousands of years, then it wouldn’t be the same church. That’s why we have freedom of religion. If the Catholics changed their beliefs then they would be Lutherans, or Protestants, or Calvinists. If one does not agree with the religion of which they are currently a member, then they can find a church that agrees with their morals. The only problem I have is that so many Catholics believe that Catholicism is the only way to get saved. When asked about Christianity, almost every Catholic I know refers to Christianity and Catholicism synonymously. It seems as if the bishops and the pope believe they are simply better than other denominations. While certainly each denomination believes it is the best and truest form, most other denominations I have witnessed believe in cooperation because their disagreements are minor. However, it seems to me like Catholics don’t even consider other churches as valid, so if I would change anything, that would be it.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'My big question would be: for what? Why did Denver decide to do this? I mean is it for medical reasons or are they going to be selling “dime bags” at the pharmacy? If marijuana is used for medical reasons to alleviate pain for example during a cancer patient’s chemotherapy then I would say yes this is a good thing. But if they were legalizing marijuana as a way to stop children from buying them then I would say that the state didn’t work hard enough to help children choose a different route. Legalizing marijuana would stop children from buying it as much because I would be tapping into the fact that people want what they can’t have. Marijuana should be legalized if it were used to help people that were in pain. But that’s the only way I feel it necessary to legalize it. If they were to legalize as a way to decrease the demand then that may lead to legalizing other drugs like cocaine or ecstasy to decrease demand. Either way you look at it marijuana is still a drug so it’s not right to legalize it. But what about alcohol isn’t alcohol a drug? Or can’t it lead to it being a drug? Why don’t we make alcohol illegal then? I digress, but my point is that we should only legalize marijuana if truly necessary. Marijuana’s effects are not similar enough to alcohol so as to legalize it. Well actually from what I have seen marijuana is actually a lot to legalize than alcohol because people who are “high” usually just sit and don’t do much. Unlike alcohol where a lot of people usually get really reckless, they are the ones who get in car accidents and say things they didn’t mean all for a good time. You really don’t hear of many people smoking weed to get more social able it’s usually to get relax. As I continually think about this I have come to the conclusion that they should only legalize marijuana if it will help sick people. Other than that they have no logical reason to legalize marijuana. Marijuana takes away from the lives of young kids who are swooped up into the gang life and killed all for some weed. Its not worth it and especially not worth the lives of innocent people who die from drive by shootings. Marijuana although it isn’t dangerous physically it is dangerous to the people that use it and even to the people that don’t.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'I believe that gender discrimination still exists towards men in that they are still looked down upon when they consider low key roles like being a stay at home dad or a nurse. For example in the movie Meet the Parents on the character’s Gaylord Fauker was constantly made fun of by her fiancée’s father because he was a nurse. I believe that men will never get out of the role of being the one that in authority, take a look at our world today there are constant examples of males in power: the Pope, and even the president up until next year’s candidate. Gender discrimination is a mindset, and the world even today is still stuck in the mentality that woman aren’t supposed to be leaders and men are. It’s a mindset that subordinates women just because we are more sensitive about others. Society sets us as being missionaries, housewives, nurses, models, and even porn stars; these are traditional female roles, and although some men choose to occupy them they are deemed the ones who aren’t “man enough” to occupy leadership roles. Gender discrimination still takes place in the workplace and in our society as a whole. If you look in magazines or in advertisements, women are always held by men or the men are always protecting the women. If a woman is holding a man or caressing a man it is seen as dominating and the man as being a punk. The I Love New York 2 series is breaking this standard. No longer is a woman looking for a man who is going to stand up to his wife and be the head of the household. New York is looking for “her wife” someone to have dinner on the table for her when she comes home. When I heard her say this I was stunned because honestly I was like “what self-respecting man want to be called his wife’s wife”? Why does our society think this? Why was this my initial reaction instead nothing like it would have been had I heard a man say this? Once again I believe it was because of our society, our society engrains in us than the man should be the protector even if he is in subordinate position like a housedad or a secretary. From previous discussions with my friends who are adamant about our gender discriminations problems in our world today, I remembered them saying that women make less than men in corporate industries. I was at first totally oblivious to this notion but apparently it is still something that goes on to this day. I often think about situations like this in our world were we recognize something bad going on, now the next step is what do we to prevent it. The U.S. tries to make laws about it but there are always ways around laws. And if the woman speaks up she may be harassed at work. So if we recognize all these problems with the workplace how do we fix it so that the workplace can be a fair and just place where everyone can receive equal opportunities.'},\n",

I bet you that many of the soldiers over there are alot more concernend about safely evacuating Iraq than about if gay people should get married.

Moreover my point is that it shouldn't matter who we are allowed to marry, if there is love in the relationship why should people who don't like it care? Because it looks weird and its different? Well alot of stuff looks weird and different but that doesn't mean we should shun it. And further more aren't homosexuals granted the right of a civil union, which is the same as a marriage except for the benefits? Well if thats the case then they should be at least happy that they got that far and work toward geting the whole U.S. to give them that right.

For people, like me who are for gay marriage I believe that homosexuals should be offered the same rights as heterosexuals because I feel that if they are feeling the same thing that I feel when I say I am in love with a man and are held back from taking the next step of marriage then its unfair. I also believe that we have to keep fighting for gay marriage because never in American history is something ever truly remembered and recognized if there wasn’t a struggle. Also its understandable, the opposition, because our society was built on heterosexual relationships, and for many this style of living is very weird, and different. What makes accepting homosexual relationships so difficult for some people is the sexual freedom, homosexuals can have sex with whomever they please and never get pregnant. I know from my friends that are homosexual that sometimes I feel the same way that people who oppose gay marriages feel because many of my friends have sex with their best friend’s partner like if its nothing and it’s something that should be expected because they are gay. So sometimes I understand where the opposition comes from because who would to legalize a sex free-for-all? However, I do believe that once homosexuals work out their kinks then people would be more receptive and vote to have gay marriages legalized. President Bush needs to stop worrying about this small problem. No one is dying, no families are being left without a home, and no children are running around with guns, from homosexuality. But he has innocent Iraqis who aren’t for his never-declared-war being homeless and killed from the anger that other Iraqis have toward the U.S. If I remember correctly from my government class isn’t it up to the states to declare legalization of gay marriage before the federal government gets involved? Once again I believe that the federal government has bigger issues than this. President Bush is allowing his personal opinion to take precedent over society’s needs. Legalizing homosexual will not hurt anyone, so why is this such a huge deal in our society. I believe that President Bush is pushing this problem as a scapegoat for dealing with the bigger problems. The U.S. has bigger problems like there huge debt and the fact that many children die because they don’t have health care, but yet he wants to meddle in the lives of people who are different then him.'},\n",

Women could only have jobs as secretaries or jobs that required helping; no real authority. Now I believe both men and women are discriminated against because of their gender. I see this in the fact that men are looked down upon if they want to be a stay at home dad or work as a secretary or a nurse. Why do men always have to have the power? For example I would like to be a nurse practioner in the emergency room, and my main reason for wanting to be a nurse practioner instead of a doctor is because I don't want all the responsibility and I want to have a family and a life outside of my career. I feel like men can't want what I want, they can't not want responsiblity and authority afterall isn't that what is ingrained in our heads as a child, men are the head of the household, they bring in the money. On the opposite spectrum women are also discriminated against in the workplace but its not as obvious. There are laws now that prevent women from being discriminated against but that doesn't mean that people don't find ways to get around those laws. I believe that women in most conservative businesses have to work twice as hard as men do who have the same criteria as they do in order to reach there level.

Or is it just as simple as sitting in front of your computer screen reading a stranger’s face book wall? I think before one can judge when the school officials can invade someone’s privacy they must distinguish what is privacy? What’s private versus non private? What does invading mean? Frankly invading can mean something as serious as invading someone’s house or discreetly listening in on someone’s conversation. Personally I feel that invading privacy can be mix of all the things previously mentioned. In this case I feel that school officials are going to look at myspace and facebook regardless of whether they are in school or not because of them probably have on anyway. I believe that it is fine to look at a student’s facebook or myspace page as long as they don’t act on anything unless someone is in danger. Moreover I believe that this was an invasion of privacy. The school officials just stopped what potentially could have been a deadly school shooting. I think that where they should draw the line: on life and death situations. If students are just trying to express themselves in there own way then no I say the school officials should just leave the students alone. But when it comes down to innocent children dying as a result of some demented child who wants to take his personal problems out on people, then I would say that the school officials are allowed to take action here. When I was in high school, three girls where asked to withdraw because of pictures they posted on face book in they displayed girl-on-girl action in the school’s bathroom facilities. My high school was a girl’s catholic high school which some would think would give them reason to ask the girls to withdraw but I don’t think so. I believe that action between girls like the way they posed is totally normal. If you think about isn’t that a characteristic that is unique to girls; we are more friendly, more sexual with our friends than boys are. But I digress, the main point is that I believe in that instance the school was using the face that the internet is a big free-for-all to incriminate the girls. I feel that school officials should draw the line at life and death situations. They should not interfere with students and their natural want to express themselves. Although the internet isn’t the safest place to express their feelings; it still gives kids a place to say what’s on their minds and not bottle it up inside. However, kids need to realize that the places like myspace are open to the public. I think that they think because it has there name on it and they are the ones controlling it that they are the only ones looking at it, however naïve that may be. Kids should understand that the World Wide Web in public domain and anyone can read their “personal” business.'}],\n",

People say that gay marriage is against their religion – well their religion isn\\'t the issue here. Under the Constitution, they have the same right to practice that religion as they always have, and to deny the marriage of homosexuals within their own churches and institutions. But states aren\\'t trying to make priests perform marriages between two gay people - the only right on debate here is the right for two male or two female names to be on the same marriage certificate. There is no way that if gay marriage is legalized, you\\'ll walk into church one day and have to watch two men kiss at the altar. This is in no way the issue, and what needs to happen is that people see that. America has to look at this issue objectively, without the emotional reasoning that thinking about it in terms of religion brings. Only then will we as a country come to see that we are denying people basic rights in the name of nothing more than personal belief. What are the disadvantages of gay marriage? People say that homosexual couples threaten the validity of heterosexual marriage and somehow make it less special. But homosexual and heterosexual couples are so fundamentally different, and yet so similar, that this will in no way happen. Living with a partner of the same sex can\\'t be the same as living with one of the opposite sex, yet they share the same feelings and roles in relationships, go through the same problems, and want the same things out of a marriage. Some people look at homosexuals as simply promiscuous people who want sex all the time without the possibility of pregnancy or commitment. From that standpoint, yes, homosexual marriage would make the institution of marriage look bad. But in fact, this is a stereotype that is in no way true. Homosexual couples have rates of commitment and break-up similar to heterosexual couples. Many live their whole lives together, sharing every experience the same way a married man and woman do. How could a committed couple make marriage look bad? There is no way the federal government should be involved in this issue, unless the constitutionl amendment changes the definition of marriage to include the union between homosexual couples at all. The separation of church and state should keep Bush from passing such an amendment, because other than a phrase written down over 100 years ago and some \"morals\" conferred on him by his religion, there is nothing behind his push. Such an amendment would be a dangerous thing for the Republican party to pass, since the gay population is a growing minority who has a vested interest in the matter. Besides, the federal government has a responsibility to protect the rights of those under it, not take them away. Whose rights are protected by banning gay marriages? The rights of heterosexual couples to be the only ones with a marriage certificate? That seems like s snobbish kind of right to protect. What about the rights of old ladies not to be offended by seeing a wedding performed between two men? Well, we defended the right of old ladies not to see a black man and a white woman holding hands in public not so long ago. That defense was known as the Jim Crow laws.

       "   'output': 'There is no legal reason to make gay marriage impossible. Decisions about whether weddings can be performed in a church and recognized as a religious union should be left up to the leaders of specific religions, and the state should stick to determining whether a union is worthy of a legal marriage certificate. Many gay couples show the same level of commitment as straight couples - they live together, raise children together, and grow old together in sickness and in health. Why should they not be given the same legal benefits and rights as straight couples? Religious arguments are perfectly valid. It is totally dependent on religious leaders to decide whether or not homosexuality is a sin or accepted by their religion, and the attitude members should take toward homosexuals. They can even decide what rights gay people will have within a religion - whether they will ever be allowed to become priests or rabbis or just allowed to be lay people. However, that has no effect ( or shouldn’t, at any rate) on the legalization of gay marriage by the government. Voters and legislators both have to start separating the two issues in their minds. The decision on whether or not to allow gay marriage should have nothing to do with personal feelings of approval or disapproval of homosexuality. Members of the gay community are part of a minority just like Hispanics or African Americans and should be treated accordingly. The government would never think of denying the right of marriage to African Americans, so why should it to homosexuals? There is no psychological difference between gay people and straight people; it’s not like they have a mental defect, they just have a different sexual orientation. They feel the same way about their partners as husbands do about their wives and vice versa, and gay relationships have been shown to be very similar to straight relationships. Children raised by gay parents have been shown to be well adjusted for the most part, and many children raised by straight couples have been shown to have psychological issues. The health of children has nothing to do with the orientation of the parents, just the methods and effectiveness of parenting, and so cannot be used as an argument against gay marriage - especially since allowing it would give children a better sense of stability and normality in their home life. President Bush’s proposal for an amendment banning gay marriage is uncalled for and highly questionable from an ethical and legal standpoint. On what grounds are we trying to deny these people a basic right that everyone else in America enjoys? They are not posing a threat to heterosexual marriage. It’s not as if by seeing the happiness of a married gay couple more people are going to become gay. Heterosexual families and gay families will always remain unique and should be treated as two separate entities, not just a deviation of a single entity. This is especially a legally charged issue because Bush is not only trying to deny a status of equality to a significant minority in the United States, but legal rights as well like housing, tax and health care advantages. The federal government should definitely be involved in this issue, but on the side of the rights of the people that it swore to uphold and protect. If gay people are allowed to live in the United States, own property here, have jobs here, shop here, and be active parts of their communities, then they deserve the same rights as heterosexual people who influence American society and economy in the same ways.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Personally, I think cigarettes should be made illegal. So why would I support the legal smoking of marijuana, which is even more harmful to the lungs? People throw lawsuits left and right when asbestos is discovered in their workplace because they’re so afraid that if they breathe it in they’ll get cancer, and some of those same people smoke two packs a day. If asbestos is illegal, cigarettes, along with their counterparts cigars, chewing tobacco, and joints, should be illegal as well by logic. The argument is made that marijuana has effects similar to alcohol on the body, and if alcohol is legal then how can marijuana be outlawed? The fact, however, remains that marijuana is significantly different from alcohol. Alcohol such as red wine has been shown in small doses to be beneficial to the body by improving heart health. Of course, like many drugs, if abused it can be extremely dangerous. But the only beneficial effect of marijuana on the body is that it relieves pain - and so do lots of other drugs. The harm of breathing in marijuana smoke far outweighs any benefits to be gained. If you’re in pain, take Vicodin or a drug that won’t give you lung cancer 20 years later. Another problem with Denver is the legalization of “small” amounts of marijuana. How does one go about regulating marijuana? There’s no proof system like for alcohol - batches of marijuana are mixed with different materials so that each has a different strength and composition. And justifying its legality by saying it can only be purchased and used in small amounts is a pretty ineffective way of controlling its use. Who’s to prevent people from purchasing multiple batches and using them all at once? And does this mean that a legal marijuana content for the body will have to be established, like the BAC, to prevent people from driving under the influence? I would like to hear how Denver plans on regulating the consumption of marijuana to keep it safe. Plus, although marijuana and alcohol are both addictive in certain situations, marijuana is known as a “gateway drug” while alcohol doesn’t usually lead to doing harder drugs. Many people who smoke marijuana move on to harder drugs like cocaine as they build up a tolerance. Allowing marijuana to be used legally could eventually lead to the legalization of other, more dangerous, drugs as well. Once marijuana use becomes commonly accepted, the standards of what constitutes “drug abuse” will change and accept other drugs like cocaine for “limited” legal use. Instead of relaxing our standards to accept more drugs, we should tighten them to include nicotine as a drug which should be made illegal. One could argue that legalization of marijuana will make it safer for those who use it, because they don’t have to follow illegal routes to get it and the composition could be federally regulated. It would eliminate some drug dealers and deaths due to contaminated drug batches. The problem is, marijuana isn’t that much of a problem in those departments. Marijuana dealers can be the kid sitting next to you in freshman English your first year of high school, and most times contaminated drug batches are an issue with more expensive and dangerous drugs that are cut with random materials. Really, legalizing marijuana will do nothing more than give the police more of a headache in deciding what is legal and what is not, and cause more lung cancer and addiction.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'I think we should never have gotten involeved in the War in Iraq in the first place, but now that we are we have certain responsibilities to take care of before we leave. It was not exactly a good decision to get involved in a full scale war without support of any other countries or the UN. If that many other governments are rleuctant to get involved, what made us think our reasons were overpowering? Well the threat of weapons of mass destruction for one. Weapons of mass destruction which mysteriously no longer exist. Oil was another, and I don\\'t see a way that we can deny that. Our government made rash decisions in the defense of the US economy, not US society and safety. We took it on ourselves to invade another country and mold it to our specifications, instead of going through diplomatic channels to work out a solution. Our problem was not only rashness, but impatience. True Iraq was ingoring UN orders in the time shortly before the war, but I feel it could have all been worked out with a much better, safer solution. Third party intervention was a must between the US and Iraq at that time, and there just wasn\\'t a strong enough force holding us back. All of these factors, as well as anti-Iraqi sentiment generated by the government, contributed to us getting into a royal mess rivaling Vietnam. But now that we\\'re there, we have to think critically to find the best way out. The problem with people who advocate an end to the war and withdrawl of all troops from Iraq immediately is that we are so intricately entangled in the whole ordeal that it is much more complicated than staying or going. I feel the war has gone on long enough indeed. Saying it\\'s over doesn\\'t make it so. The war will never be over until we slowly remove troops over time and start rebuilding by a different process - through diplomatic channels. We can do more good for Iraq from far away than we can by staying smack in the middle. Sometimes you can\\'t see the forest through the trees - we are losing perspective and the big picture the longer we stay in Iraq. What we need is to remover ourselves from the situation slowly and look at it objectively. We need to remove the USA from the equation entirely - right now we are looking at Iraq in terms of life here, and trying to fix it so that it fits our image of what life should be like. Instead, we need to look at life in Iraq now in terms of the way it has been previously. It has changed indeed over the past few years but it will never be what we want it to, for the simple fact that Iraq is NOT the US and never will be. I feel sad when I think about the war because I think it is a prime example of how emotion gets in the way of rationality. Because everyone was so riled up and angry after 9-11, Bush was able to raise enough support for a war against Iraq. This move had probably been considered by politicians for years, but the time was finally right. We now not only had economic issues at stake in Iraq, but also humanitarian ones with Saddam Hussein\\'s abuses and security ones with the weapons of mass destruction. As a country, we made bad decisions during that time. Now we need to do what is necessary to change our image in the eyes of the world, and to prove that we can be rational and mature. We need to be responsible, to admit that this has gone too far, and to ask for intervention on the part of the UN to mediate relations between us and Iraq because the direct route isn\\'t working, and hasn\\'t worked for a long time. When something isn\\'t getting you the results expected, \"change is the future\", don\\'t just \"stay the course\".'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an email response to a someone who asked you the following: Do you feel the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?',\n",
       "   'output': 'I think the Catholic Church has been in a constant process of growth ever since its conception. It\\'s not like it has never changed - The Protestant Reformation and Vatican II are examples of two massive overhauls in Church doctrine and practice. Yet there are lots of issues today that the Church is not addressing properly - tradition is not a good answer to the issue of women preists or gay marriage. It doesn\\'t attract people to the church when they hear that women can\\'t be priests because 2000 years ago people were not enlightened enough to listen when women spoke in the name of Jesus, so he picked men as his apostles instead. Everyone knows that that has changed, and they want the church to reflect the new status of women in the world. Pope John Paul II did well in his time as Pope to bring the Church into the new millenium. He made the Church more accessible to common people, and by visiting other countries as a sort of ambassador, in effect globalized it. In this era of global trade and world economy, it was good to have a Pope who spoke the languages of so many people, and who showed obvious love for each one of them. But the doctrines of the church are much more entrenched and hard to change than its public image. Supporters of strict laws in the church can find evidence anywhere in the Bible supporting their ideas. But perception of the Bible has also changed over the years - it is no longer accepted by many as literal fact, ever since the Scopes Monkey trial. In fact, among many theologians and Biblical scholars, it is widely accepted that the Bible should be viewed realistically - as a book of meaninful stories and lessons created by Church leaders to unify and teach their followers. If the Bible were to be created today by the same leaders of the church, it would undoubtedly be different in many, many ways. So why should we keep basing our lives on the \"laws\" written in a book centuries ago, in another place and time entirely? The MESSAGE of the Bible is what\\'s important. Love your neighbor, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, God loves you etc, not \"a man is unclean for 24 hours after he has lain with a woman.\" That one went out the window... so whats keeping the law where gays should be shunned and stoned taken as the word of God himself? In regard to the issue of pedophilia, there is nothing the church could have done or changed to prevent that. A pedophile is a pedophile - it is a psycholigical illness, not just repressedsexual energy. I think that rather than a good proportion of priest becoming pedophiles, a good portion of pedophiles became priests to try and control their urges. They probably thought the church would give them stronger morals and convictions, and that they would be able to control their thoughts and actions better as priests. Instead, what it did was give them even less supervision (hey, everyone trusts a priest) and even more freedom to be alone with small children and to fantasize about them. Allowing female priests and married priests would probably enhance the quality of life among priests, but would not make any greater or smaller percentage of them pedophiles. What the church could have done was to keep a closer watch on the health of its priests. I\\'m sure none of them entered the priesthood saying \"Oh boy, this will give me a chance to have sex with kids.\" They probably felt extreme guilt over their feelings and actions, and probably would have sought help for it if they thought they would be supported. I\\'m sure none of these men were particularly bad people, they just had psychological problems and a lack of control. If priests could be assured that they could get psychological help whenever they needed it, and not necessarily from other priests but from real doctors, then I think the incidence rate of occasions like this would go down. Also, the curch should not have covered up incidences when they did occur, but gotten help for the involved priests and let the public know in a timely manner. Instead, the whole thing backfired on them and the newspapers got to have a grand expose. The church should change many of its own internal customs and rules, and that includes trying to always be judge and jury. Sometimes people just need outside help.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: Do you feel the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?',\n",
       "   'output': 'I think the Catholic Church came a long way during the papacy of Pope John Paul II in terms of modernizing and reaching out to people of the world today, but still has many changes to make to fully adapt to life in the 21st century. It’s very hard to balance the value of traditions such as not allowing birth control with modern values today and will by no means be an easy or quick process, although that is what people are calling for. The problem is that such an evolution of society and technology has taken place over the past hundred or so years that an institution like the Church that has undergone a minimal amount of change since its inception 2000 is an anachronism. It will take patience on the part of everyone involved to bring the Catholic Church to a resolution with the standards of modern people. There are many aspects of Church doctrine that should be updated, like not allowing women priests or priests to be married. In a society where women and men have achieved equal roles, or are trying to, it is important that an institution advocating equal rights should put into practice what it preaches. There is no reason except tradition that women should not be priests, not to say that traditions are useless. There are plenty of good traditions the can remind us of our heritage or unite people as a family or even a country, like the Fourth of July. But when traditions are followed blindly for centuries without question, they can turn into harmful biases and inhibit change and growth. There are many traditions the Catholic Church should hold on to, but the Latin Mass wasn’t one of them and celibate priests aren’t either. There is much to be said for keeping strongly to convictions in the face of opposition, and the Catholic Church has been good at that from the moment of its birth. But there is also much to be said for reviewing one’s convictions in light of the situation. In the Bible, God told Moses that lepers were ritually unclean, but Jesus, in a much later place and time, declared that lepers were God’s children as much as any of us and were to be treated like so. Vatican II proves that we don’t have to wait for Christ’s second coming to see changes happen in the Church. Many aspects of Church tradition were changed then and Catholicism didn’t fall apart. It may have lost some members who were upset by a change, but it gained many more who found the new, more modern Church more accessible to them. There are going to be positive and negative consequences to a change in any organization as far-reaching and ancient as the Catholic Church, but long term benefits must be considered as well as the immediate emotional responses that are sure to happen among members. As to the recent bout of pedophilia accusations dealing with Catholic priests, I believe that to be a separate issue from modernization in the Church. Pedophilia is a serious mental illness, and there are both genetic and environmental aspects to the expression of any mental illness. Perhaps there is such a relatively high rate of pedophilia among priests because many men who felt unnatural attraction to children became priests in hopes that the constant exposure to religion and vows of celibacy would keep their urges in check. In any case, they were all well aware that no female priests were allowed and they would never be getting married. If once they were priests they were overwhelmed with the responsibility or felt the call to marriage, they could have left the priesthood. Although this isn’t easy and s heavily disapproved of, it’s not as if you’re going to jail or the Catholic Church will take out a bounty on your head if you leave the priesthood. I think there are a lot of things the Church could do to modernize itself and make itself more in tune to its members, but it can’t influence whether or not priests are pedophiles. Who knows how long this problem has existed - just because in the past few years it has been exposed doesn’t mean it’s new at all. The Church should remove priests with pedophilia from power positions and get them the help they need, but it should concentrate on reaching out to the modern world.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an email response to a someone who asked you the following: Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States?',\n",
       "   'output': 'I think gender discrimination is very much still an issue in the US workplace, and will be for probably the rest of my lifetime. There has been a lot of progress in this area though, aspecially recently as more and more women become well paid executives. Women are discriminated against daily, and not just in pay. The way they are treated by men in the workplace, especially their bosses, is discrimination by its very definition. Many women are not treated equally, and not treated the same as men. Whenever a man makes a comment about a woman\\'s body, or a boss pinches a butt, that\\'s discrimination. It\\'s demeaning for the woman, and in many cases can cause her to feel uncomfortable in the workplace and even have to change jobs. The workplace should be an equal playing field for everyone, women shouldn\\'t be made to feel inferior like that. Noone should have to feel that their boss is coming on to them, and think \"Oh, maybe if I just sleep with him just once, he\\'ll open a trapdoor in the glass ceiling.\" That ceiling just shouldn\\'t be there in the first place. Pay is becoming much more equal in the salaried desk jobs where it was first raised as an issue. Overall, women are hired much more often, which was the first big step. Company regulations about pay and treatment are much stricter for fear of lawsuit. Yet you still hear about the woman getting paid 75% of what a man doing her same job is getting, or the woman who enters an interview and leaves with \"I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just not what we\\'re looking for.\" Eventually, the way things are going, this will hopefully disappear from society. Men are discriminated against in the workplace as well. In traditionally female occupations like nurse or daycare provider, they may not only be teased by co-workers but by anyone they meet. However, the discrimination against men does not usually include such aspects as pay discrimination or unwanted sexual attention, so it is not as serious. I think it\\'s rare for a man to leave his job because the workplace environment was made uncomfortable by excessive teasing. This is also becoming less and less prevalent as men appear on TV doing traditionally female things – as hairstylists on Project Runway and What Not to Wear, as nurses on ER and Grey\\'s Anatomy, and in many other roles. The same thing is happening to women, as more and more women appear in positions of power in popular TV shows. Like it or not, TV is a powerful influence on society today. Trends are set through TV, and it teaches us social norms. By seeing women running businesses on TV, men believe it is more acceptable when they see it done in real life. This also means that younger generations will grow up accepting these things as normal. As long as powerful women are portrayed in a positive light and respected on TV, the younger generation will fell that it is acceptable for a woman to have a higher paying job than her husband, and to even be a top CEO. Women will be known for performing differently then men, but no better and no worse. It will be seen as good to have the differing perspectives of men and women working together on one issue. Parents need to help along this change in sentiment by talking about women in a positive light in front of their children. Negative attitudes like \"That\\'s not her place\" and \"She should be home with the kids\" are what will drag potentially successful women down. Also, parents should encourage their female children to choose challenging professions, and to educate them about the variety of possibilities open to them. When all of these things come about, discrimination will truly no longer be an issue in the workplace.'}],\n",
       " 8: [{'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin. Do you think this was an invasion of privacy?',\n",
       "   'output': 'I absolutely do not think this example was an invasion of privacy. For one, myspace is a public website, and anyone can access information there. Just because a school official saw information about a school shooting does not mean that the subject’s privacy was breached. How can one even argue that is was a violation of privacy rights? What should this official have done – just ignore the threatening information because it might violate the privacy rights of someone planning a school shooting? This issue is plain common sense. When people are in danger, privacy rights – nearly all civil rights – take a back seat. The bigger issue here is the distinction between right and wrong. When you come right down to it, that is what all decisions in today’s world should be based on. The benefit of saving innocent lives from a troubled teenager greatly outweigh the possibly violating the privacy rights of an individual. We should be so lucky as Americans that we are free in so many ways. Maybe having so much freedom and so many rights is not always a good thing. When an official utilizes information to prevent violence, many people get offended. In any other country, everyone would be thankful that a school shooting had been prevented. Not America. Americans and American lawyers are always looking to score some easy money by suing others for ridiculous reasons. Maybe that is what this individual is trying to do – claiming that his privacy rights were violated in order to hide the real issue. He was wrong and he got caught. End of story. “Privacy rights” is a very loose definition. I think that people in this day and age are too sensitive. These “violations” are meant to protect people, not hurt them. What’s the big deal if the authorities adapt to your actions and catch you doing something wrong. If you’re wrong to begin with, then you should be caught. I support the Patriot Act because it is designed to protect people. It is not designed to be a modern-day version of big brother. If school shooters, or terrorists, or what have you, have learned to utilize the internet, it is a logical progression for the authorities to utilize it as well. It’s evolution. One side adapts, and the other side follows. What are the negative consequences to law-abiding citizens? In short, nothing. If you aren’t doing illegal things, then you are safe. If you are doing illegal things, then you aren’t safe. Only positive things can come from the authorities looking for dangerous signals. Just look at the results. Lives were saved from a school shooting because someone acted on information. I can see phone tapping as a controversial subject, but accessing information on the internet? Please. The internet is a public place and is designed for the easy access and sharing of information. I can’t understand how someone would think someone’s privacy rights are more important than people’s lives. This is an example of the backwards way of thinking of many people in the United States today.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The Catholic Church is a very conservative and regressive organization when compared to other organizations and religions throughout the world. They have an attitude of acting the way they want to act – disregarding the opinions of others, even those within the Church. In today’s modern world the Church still has an empire of sorts. Vatican City is but a shadow of the Holy Roman Empire, but it still shows that the Church is interested in temporal power, instead of just focusing on spirituality. The pope is supposed to be the leader of the Church. I see the pope as a way for the Catholic Church to proclaim infallibility in all of its doctrines and teachings. The pope is no better than any man off the street. Why should he be the “voice of God on earth?” I disagree with the highly structured organization of personnel the Church has come up with. What power have priests been given that they can administer God’s forgiveness? I believe each person should bypass the middleman/priest and converse directly with God. The Church would not have this, however, because it would mean that they would have to amend some of their practices. That’s one thing that the Church very rarely does. They don’t like to admit that they’re wrong, because that would jeopardize everything they have proclaimed over the years. Take their stance on homosexuality, for example. They actually believe, in this day and age, that being gay is a sin. This is why the Church needs to adapt to life in the 21st century. Being gay is biological – it is not a result of the person in question choosing to be gay. And so what if that person did choose to be gay? People are different, so let them be the way they are without trying to say that God doesn’t approve. This is just one example of how the Catholic Church breeds exclusivity. The Church refuses to modernize, even when science has made such great strides. Scientists now have the capability to utilize embryonic stem cells to quite possibly cure some of the most deadly diseases. It is ridiculous that the Church would say that scientists should not pursue embryonic stem cell research because it is “immoral.” Who is the Church to decide what is and is not moral? Oh, that’s right, God tells them everything that’s right and wrong in this world. I still can’t figure out why Catholic priests aren’t allowed to marry. It makes no economic sense to force the priests to be celibate. In doing so, the undoubtedly reduce the amount of people who become priests. I mean, how many people would willingly throw away their sex lives for some far-fetched explanation? Not many, as the Church is figuring out. I do think that the pedophilia scandal could have been prevented if priests were allowed to have sex. It’s a fact of humanity that all people have sexual desires, and when outlets for those desires are stripped away, the priests turn to the easiest way around the restrictions. It is the fault of the Church’s unwillingness to change that so many young boys were molested. I’m not absolving the priests, but I guess they were kinda backed into a corner by the Catholic Church.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this?',\n",
       "   'output': 'Let me begin by saying that I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. There are hundreds of different drugs that we dispense daily, all of them having some medical purpose. We have many drugs that are known as “controlled substances.” These drugs must always be kept under lock and key because of their addictive properties. We have several derivatives of opiates like morphine and dilaudid that are very similar in structure to heroin. These drugs are legal, but they are controlled, and the system works very well. We occasionally dispense THC in tablet form, the active ingredient in marijuana. The point is this. Marijuana, when used for medical purposes can be quite beneficial. Just because it is an illegal drug, people think it has nothing but bad properties. Marijuana should become legal for medical use because it can help people struggling with glaucoma or cancer. Past experience shows that highly addictive drugs can be used safely when they are labeled with the “controlled substance” tag. However, I believe it would be a mistake to allow the public to freely use marijuana, as Denver has done somewhat. People would abuse marijuana because they have been used to so many years of being told they can’t have it. When you tell people they can’t have something, it is natural for them to want to get it. It would be a very big risk to public safety. People would be driving when they are high, because they would think that since marijuana is now legal, they can legally drive around with it in their bloodstream. Accidents would increase, and more people would get hurt. Once the taboo of marijuana has been done away with (this would take many years), then I would say that it can be safely legalized, in much the same way as alcohol is today. Marijuana’s effects are not so nasty that it turns people into zombies. It is not addictive, and it is hard to overdose with it. For these reasons, I believe that it should not be treated as harshly as other illegal drugs like cocaine and heroine. It quite simply is not that bad. But the government has chosen to come down hard on marijuana, probably because it was once widely used (and still is). Because the government says marijuana is so bad, people naturally try to get their hands on it. They in effect have shot themselves in the foot by prohibiting its usage completely and tricking people into thinking that its worse than it really is. Marijuana is a drug in its own category. Cocaine and heroine could never be legalized for public usage, but I think marijuana, with time, could be. With time is the key word. First, I say make it available for medical use. Then, with time, the taboo surrounding marijuana will dissipate, and people will be able to use it responsibly. Also, it is worth noting that the prison systems are way too overfilled. This is largely the result of teenagers getting caught with marijuana. Legalizing marijuana could be a long term remedy for this problem.'},\n",

If you are doing illegal things, like planning a school shooting, then it looks as if \"invasion of privacy\" is a good thing after all. The Patriot Act falls somewhat into this category. This act is designed to protect us. No one cares about information that might be embarrassing to a certain person. The NSA monitors phone conversations that contain key words linked to the possibility of terrorist action. The analysts who monitor these calls don\\'t care about individual people.

       "   'output': 'Let me begin by saying that I believe war is a horrible thing, but it is sometimes unavoidable. To say that we can live in a world without war is naïve. There will always be those who are willing to use war to further their objectives, or to prevent something bigger down the road. In the case of the United States and Iraq, we went to war because we had intelligence that strongly suggested that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction or the capacity to make them. George Bush, and others, made the decision to remove this threat. I believe it was the right decision. It really is not our place to make an opinion on the political decisions of our leaders for the simple fact that we do not possess the entire picture like they do. They are the ones who make educated decisions, not us. I think we have to put our trust in our leaders. George Bush is not out to take over the world – he just wants to be good at his job. People will criticize Bush for the Iraq war, saying that it has gone on for too long, and that too many American lives were lost. What if the United States had not gone to war, and Saddam decided to wipe Israel off the map with nuclear tipped missiles? Or, a more likely scenario would be that Saddam would sell weapons of mass destruction to terrorists who would eventually use them in the United States. Tens of thousands of lives would have been lost. Then people would criticize Bush for not taking action. You see, hindsight always has you coming out smelling like roses. It is not our job to determine what the United States should do in the world arena. We should leave it up to the CIA, NSA, and all the other agencies whose job it is to protect us. They collect and analyze an enormous amount of intelligence and provide suggestions based on that intelligence. We should let the experts do their jobs. Since we have already begun the war, we cannot just pick up and leave now that it has gotten unpopular. We have to train the Iraqi military and police force, and make sure they have the capacity to defend their nation. Once the job is done, then we can leave. I know that a substantial amount of American soldiers have died as a result of the Iraq war. Compared to other wars, however, the number of lives lost in the Iraq war is miniscule. There have been losses in the thousands in the Iraq war. In WWII, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were killed. I think it feels like its worse than it actually is because of the media and the way it likes to chronicle every life lost. It’s not a matter of whether the war has “gone on long enough.” Some wars just last longer than others. The key is that the objectives must be completed, and as of yet, they have not.'},\n",

In this day and age, it is simply not wise for employers to practice gender discrimination. If it is apparent that they are doing this, they will find themselves facing a lawsuit that they are likely to lose. It just makes good business sense to be an equal opportunity employer. I do think that women use gender discrimination as a crutch in modern society. Many women want to be equal in every way, shape, and form as men. Biology will teach us, however, that men and women are physically different. There is no disputing this fact. As a result, men tend to be stronger than women. Consequently, there are jobs in which men are preferred over women because the worker needs to be strong. Man employers who need a strong individual will choose a man over a woman. This is not because of gender discrimination. The employer is just being smart. Gender discrimination is a thing of the past.

       "   'output': 'This is one issue that I am completely on one side. Gay people should be allowed to marry. There really isn’t a good reason not to let them marry. Those who oppose it say that it would “compromise the family unit.” Are you kidding me? This is their main argument. Can they see into the future and know that married gay people will destroy family life? No. They have no factual basis for their argument. Gay people are perfectly capable of raising children, maybe even more so that heterosexual couples. I say this because two gay people who want to have kids must overcome disapproval from society so much so that if they only kinda wanted kids, they would not do it. Consequently they would most likely be excellent parents. This issue only exists because of homophobes and the Catholic Church. They have this idea that if gays are allowed to marry, Armageddon is sure to follow. The truth is that the vast majority of people in this world are heterosexual. The gay people aren’t going to take over the world. They simply want to have the same rights as straight couples. Gay people should not be punished for something they were born with. It is perfectly natural to be gay, just as it is perfectly natural to have red hair. Do people think gay people want to be gay? Who would want to put up with all the ridicule they must endure throughout their lives? What if we were to say that straight biracial couples could not marry? Doing such a thing would be out of the question. I feel that it’s the same way with gay marriage. There really is no difference from a normal marriage except that gay people cannot procreate. So what? This is where the Catholic Church gets involved. They autocratically declare that God says it is necessary for married couples to have children. God didn’t tell them anything. He tells the pope, the priests, whomever, about as many things as He tells a frog. The Catholic Church should limit themselves to matters of faith, because they have no physical proof or facts for anything, including the existence of God. The only reason people are opposed to gay marriage is that they’re homophobic. Gay people aren’t out to hurt straight people. They just want to share each others’ love through marriage. We will look back 100 years from now and wonder how we could be so barbaric, forbidding two people to marry based on sexual orientation. This is the most apparent form of civil rights today, bar none. It’s outrageous that people are opposed to this.

       "   'output': 'While gay marriage is a touchy political subject, I don\\'t understand why some people are so opposed to it. Their main argument against gay marriage is that it corrupts the American family unit. To this, I say: Look at all the married couples who get divorced – the American family unit is far from perfect. I think allowing two people of the same sex to marry would actually reduce rates. This is because gay people currently have to endure so many hardships if they want to get married. If they choose to get married, or seek marriage, they will have to face a lot of criticism from outside sources. As a result, gay couples will be less likely to get married on a whim, as many straight couples undeniably do. If people learn one thing during their time on earth, I think it should be that all people are different. Homosexuality is not a \"life choice.\" Gay people are simply attracted to the same sex. True, they comprise the minority of the population when it comes to sexual orientation, but society should still accept homosexuality for what it is. If gay marriage does become legal, who is it going to hurt. You are going to see gay couples anywhere you go, so you can\\'t escape reality. Gays aren\\'t out to take over the world, they simply want to have the same rights as heterosexuals. To make them a separate class of individuals is cowrdly and childish. It\\'s the year 2006. We need to accept people for who they are. My uncle is gay, and he is just like everybody else (except his sexual orientation).

Is it up to the federal government, or is it up to state legislatures? Is it up to municipal clerks and judges? Does the full faith and credit clause of the constitution apply when “activist judges” alter marriage’s basic definition? Does it always have to be amongst a man and a woman? These questions, and more, are among the hangnails which plague today’s gay marriage debate, and slowly distract our political system from addressing objectives which are much more important. Many “religious righters” see homosexual marriage as a harbinger of the apocalypse, and carry on a “moral crusade” (more like a “moral charade”) against it. To them, the definition of marriage (as between a man and a woman) shant be changed, for if it changes, society will fall apart at the seams! Many of them extend the effects of gay marriage, rhetorically, to entirely new realms of being. “Well, if men can marry men, and women can marry women, then how long is it before people start marrying horses? Sheep? Inanimate objects? Washing machines?”. There isn’t really much merit to these questions. The one respectable assertion which “homo haters” have left is that of their personal values. To many, the idea of homosexual marriage is deeply offensive, and shocks the moral conscience. To many, it contradicts their dear religious values to the very core. This is perfectly acceptable, and for this reason, I do not think that “gay marriage” is a good idea. We can’t allow homosexual couples to join in a relationship called “marriage”, for if we do, these people will go beserk. Indeed, homosexual “marriage” is unacceptable. However, nobody is asking the government to force church doors open. Nobody is asking for legislation which would require specific faiths to recognize gay marriages. This would be a catastrophic collision of church and state. Rather, we should extend the state-offered benefits of “marriage” to homosexual couples. They don’t have to actually stand on a catholic alter before a catholic priest, but, they should be able to do some sort of paperwork which secures them the legal advantages afforded to married couples. Lets call it something else besides marriage – civil union, enjoining, magic pony ceremony, whatever, it really doesn’t matter what we call it, as long as it isn’t marriage. By removing marriage from the religious realm and highlighting solely its legal advantages, we remove the religious argument from the sphere of relevancy. After all, things like hospital visiting rights, spousal tax benefits, and mortgage co-signing were NOT proscribed by god, do not appear in the bible, and thus, don’t need to be safeguarded by the religious right. We should allow homosexual couples to enjoy these benefits without affording the religious right the luxury of having something to whine about. I can’t see any reason why this isn’t a good objective.

       "   'output': 'Questions about privacy usually boil down to the reconciliation of individual rights with collective security. Whether we are talking about high school safety or national security, the same fundamental questions persist – how might we preserve privacy, yet also preserve the safety of our environment? What level of intrusion is appropriate for, on one hand, the apprehension of potentially dangerous criminals, yet on the other hand, the preservation of personal privacy? From town police (who identify potential school shooters on MySpace) right on up to federal law enforcement agencies (who, under recent congressional provisions, record our phone calls without court warrant), the American political system is grappling with this question presently. The problem I can most plainly identify is one of subversive government conduct. I am struggling to accept that my country, which I love, has executive agencies who, to the end of national security, justify means like waterboarding. I was made to memorize certain rhetoric about the foundation of my “American” culture in elementary school; namely about how my country’s respect for individual freedom is unparalleled throughout history. I thoroughly believed this for a long time. I am/was proud to say that my grandfather fought, and almost gave his life, for these ideals in World War II. I see a fundamental contradiction between freedom, which he fought for, and torture. Seeing this contradiction does not make me “unpatriotic”. I just want to know, is there a great American “underbelly” which we, the general public, are not privy to? Are we really so paranoid that subversive measures are necessary? I quickly got over the issue of wiretapping – as it didn’t really affect me. However, I’m beginning to think that wiretapping is just the issue of the iceberg. Let’s say, hypothetically, that an extension of our executive intelligence branch, like the NSA, offered unsuspecting college student-citizens a gratuitous amount of money to submit treatises on their political views. This organization might solicit responses about hot-button political issues which directly affect it, such as the Iraq war effort and wiretapping. Let’s say participating citizens then weren’t at all informed about the source of their enumeration. Hypothetically, it might be called a “study about the way people communicate”. If it were truly a study about how people communicate, wouldn’t the organization would be forthcoming and inform all participants of exactly *what* they were getting themselves into? Citizens with nothing to hide need not worry about wiretapping, right? Reflexively, shouldn’t agencies with nothing to hide be more forthcoming as well? I had to ask lots and lots of questions to figure out exactly who was funding this study, and when I finally figured it out, it made a lot of sense. I’m not sure exactly why this study is happening, or why my peers and I are being asked to submit these essays on privacy, Iraq, marijuana, gender rights, or other hot button issues. We are being paid gratuitous amounts of money to do so, which is nice. I suppose I’ll just think of it as an extension of my income tax refund. I don’t want to jump to ridiculous “conspiracy theory” conclusions about this study, but it is quite easy to do so. I had to ask many pointed questions to figure out who is funding this study and where these essays are going. Once I found out, I sort of sat in denial for a while. It seems odd that, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, essays like this one will be categorized by NSA data analysts. Are you looking for subversive citizens? Or are you just trying to find potential candidates for employment? I can’t possibly see how this could actually be a study about “how people communicate”, of all the motives which could drive this study, that seems among the least likely/least feasible. If anyone wants to get in touch with me and explain all these details, that would be great. But I know it will probably never happen. Supposedly, this essay will not even be tied to my identity (sure, like that’s believable). I do not mean to sound so vindictive, but as I sat down to write this essay, I started drowning in irony: I was asked to write an essay on privacy, and the very circumstances under which I was asked could be construed to be an invasion of the same. So don’t peg me for a terrorist or label me a threat to society, because honestly, that would just be silly modern McCarthyism. I’m a concerned, informed, patriotic, home-loving American. If it ever really came down to it, I’d absolutely fight for my country. But I am not stupid, and I take notice of ALL my surroundings with great care and detail.

       "   'output': 'Marijuana costs our legal system a great amount of money every year, yet has a tremendous potential to adversely affect those who use it. It is indubitable that users of the drug can experience adverse effects in a number of ways. It is harmful to the respiratory system, depositing tar and toxins in the lungs similarly to cigarettes. In the first half of this century, there was a big push by a small group of people to create a state of “marijuana prohibition”, the push was successful, and we still have it in the majority of America today. Maybe in the end, marijuana prohibition is a good thing, because it prevents a “national overload” of usage. For instance, it wouldn’t be good for everyone to be driving cars high all the time, we’d probably see a lot more accidents and traffic problems. However, laws obviously don’t stop teenagers and adults alike from attaining and smoking marijuana. So I guess the question we must be asking is “do the costs of prohibition outweigh its benefits?”. The biggest benefit of marijuana prohibition is that it satisfies the majority of Americans who have a moral objection to smoking marijuana. It keeps these people happy, as many of them say “if we repealed marijuana prohibition, our entire country would go down the moral toilet!” (as if it hasn’t already). However, keeping marijuana illegal is very costly. Every time police arrest someone for smoking or possessing marijuana, there is a lot of state resources that must be expended to transport, detain, book, charge, and sentence that person. Court fees, police fees, probate fees, and the like end up draining state coiffeurs of money that could better be spent somewhere else. But honestly, I’m not sure that the money freed up by making marijuana decriminalized would really achieve any benefit which outweighs that of marijuana prohibition. If we legalize marijuana fully, we will probably see an explosion in usage which will be nothing but detrimental for us as a country. I know people who smoke marijuana and they are entirely debilitated when they do it. I certainly wouldn’t want to live in a world where everyone is high all the time. The city of Denver didn’t exactly legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21, it “decriminalized” them. This might be a good middle ground – we can still keep marijuana illegal, only it will be more of a citation than a full criminal charge. My understanding is that, with decriminalization, possession of marijuana will be more like a speeding ticket than a criminal charge. This would probably be a good middle ground, as we could keep marijuana under control, but not have to pay the costly fees that go along with marijuana being entirely illegal. Also, if I were dying of cancer, I’d probably try marijuana, because chemotherapy probably sucks. Honestly, I don’t know the answer to this question; marijuana has never really been something that affected me directly, so I’m not sure what the best course of action is. I trust our legislature to find the appropriate remedy to the marijuana problem.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The Catholic Church has been around for a very, very long time, and has certainly seen its ups and downs. At the beginning of this semester, one of my professors mentioned that we’d be learning about “Popes gone wild, or if you’ll have it, Renaissance papacy!”. During the renaissance and immediately pre-Luther days, the church certainly saw its dark days. I suppose that what it all comes down to is the integrity of the people in charge. I mean, the church has done some great things in terms of humanitarian aid and human decency, and many of its fundamental messages are good. Christianity (and Catholocism, as one of its sub-sects) has some fundamentally good messages at its heart. The messages that we are supposed to take from the Bible center around human decency and improvement. We are supposed to treat each other well, and care for each of our fellow human beings as if they are brothers and sisters. However, these messages don’t always make it through. Religion is the manner in which human beings go about answering questions that are essentially unanswerable (Who created us? Why? What is the meaning of our existence? What happens after we die?). People tend to become overly passionate when answering these questions, and even defensive about their “righteousness”. Many people pervert the essential Christian messages for their own ends. For instance, the “religious right” which has begun to pervade the American political system. They distract our politicians and citizens from important issues, such as globalization’s effects on human rights, the environmental consequences of our actions, and our coming energy crisis. When these things hit us harder, people will probably be like “Hey wait, we should have done something about this when those asshole media-frenzied church people were complaining about gay marriage and abortion”. Gay marriage and abortion are semi-important questions, but they don’t need to be fought as crusades. In fact, I think Catholocism and Christianity are inherently un-political, and should be kept as such. They are supposed to be implemented on a personal level – we are supposed to love our neighbors, treat people well, not steal, kill, or cheat, and in general, be kind. We are supposed to focus on ourselves and our conduct, and are made to believe that if we do a good job then we will be eternally rewarded (the carrot, dangling from the stick, which draws people in). With more relevance to the prompt, the pedophile priest phenomena was unfortunate for its victims, surely. However, I’m glad that it finally knocked the Catholic church off its high-horse of infallible legitimacy. The pedophilia allegations constitute chapter 2344687 in the book of “Horribly Evil Things Done By Clergy Since The Beginning of Recorded Time”, figuratively. So basically, I don’t really want anything to do with the Catholic church, because when you devote yourself to a certain predetermined series of beliefs, you are limiting yourself from full comprehension of those other than your own. Before anyone becomes a Catholic, they should first study Islam, Judaism, and other religions. If they don’t, they are probably just sticking within their comfort zone and flocking to what they are comfortable with (namely, the religion which is most commonly expressed around them). I hate it when people say “hey my religion is great, you are going to hell”.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'Because sites like MySpace are public sites and pretty much everyone is aware that whatever is posted on a MySpace site is readable by the general public I do not think that it was invasion of privacy to use information posted on a students MySpace to stop a school shooting. Considering that in doing this, the school saved the lives of its students, I think that their actions were completely justified. If the student wanted what they posted to be private, then they should have written it in a diary or a blog. By posting it in a bulletin, they were putting it out there for anyone to see and have access to. Considering sites such as MySpace and Facebook are used to find information on future employees and to use against many teens that go to court, it is no surprise that schools are jumping on the bandwagon to find information about their students. I do not think this was an invasion of privacy because when I think of privacy, I definitely do not think of MySpace. MySpace is a place where anyone can find out anything about you if you post it on your page and if a creepy old man can stalk teenage girls through it and that not be considered an invasion of privacy, then protecting students by using information posted on a MySpace should not be either. If there are things that you do not want people to know, then you should not put it where everyone can see it. On MySpace it is possible to post private blogs that can only be read by the creator of the page or certain friends chosen by the creator so it is almost as though he wanted to get caught. By posting a bulletin the student was basically sending out a letter to everyone who was on his friend list and I’m sure many of the people he is MySpace friends with are his classmates, and if one of them saw the post and it was something they were genuinely concerned about I am sure they would have said something to a parent or teacher just to be on the safe side. It is almost the fault of the student who posted the bulletin that the shooters were caught. Typically things like this are meant to be secret and a surprise attack, but by announcing the plan to the world, he took that away and he really has no one to blame but himself. What I do think would be an invasion of privacy is going into a students locker or backpack or any other private item owned by the student. I know that lockers are technically school property, but I do consider going into a locker without a really good reason unfair and unlawful. I also do not agree with schools doing such things as bringing in drug sniffing dogs. I think that it is important that students feel safe while they are in school, but I also think that it is important that the administration does not violate the rights of the students.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Although marijuana is a drug, it is a lot less potent than most and in my opinion, a lot less dangerous. In all honesty, it would probably be a lot less expensive and less trouble just to legalize marijuana. I don’t think what Denver did was a bad idea at all because by legalizing the drug and putting standards on it, they are actually giving themselves more power and minimizing crime. I personally think that smoking anything is a disgusting habit, but marijuana is so widely already used that it is not really a going to make much of a difference I don’t think. If anything, it’ll take some of the glamour away from it. Just because drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes is legal does not mean everyone is going to go out and do it, it’s just an option. Also, using marijuana is a lot less dangerous than drinking alcohol. You can’t overdose and die by smoking too much marijuana, whereas with alcohol, you can overdose and die by drinking too much. In my experience, I find that alcohol has much more dangerous and inhibiting effects than marijuana does. Legalizing other drugs would be a bad idea because they can and often do end in fatality, but smoking marijuana has about the same health risks as smoking cigarettes minus the mild hallucinogenic effects. If marijuana were sold in controlled environments like alcohol is, it would greatly reduce crime, and make the drug safer because you would not have to worry about what it was laced with. It would have a standard price and unit it was sold in and this would eliminate the possibility of being cheated out of your money. This would give the government the same monitoring capabilities as is has with alcohol. Obviously, driving under the influence of marijuana should still be punished much like alcohol is, but it would be a lot harder to prove and detect unless an accident occurred because that would warrant probable cause to test the driver. Regardless of whether or not marijuana is legalized, it is still going to be smoked by a large population of the Americans, so the government might as well cut their losses and legalize it. I don’t think it could get any worse by doing so, so really what is there to lose at this point? The war against legalizing marijuana has gone nowhere, and this country is in far too deep to eliminate it all together. At this point, that would be impossible because someone will find some way to smuggle it in or grow it, and the harder it becomes to get, the more expensive it becomes, and the more appealing it is to market because of all the money involved. The only way to end the madness is for the government to control the entire market and by doing this they will put many criminals and drug dealers out of business. This also frees up space in jail for those who were incarcerated for possession of marijuana and allow the police to focus on more serious crimes. Overall, I think this is the best solution.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'Although gender discrimination is not nearly as big an issue as it has been in the past, I do feel as though it is still an issue in the present-day United States. Women have really moved their way to the top in today’s society. They are able to do pretty much all of the same things as men, such as hold high positions in jobs, become pastors and ministers, and are not obligated to stay at home and raise the family and take care of the house. Although a lot of gender discrimination is not vocalized in such places as the work place and in politics, its presence is still there. In such situations when women are competing against men for positions, men are typically more likely to get the position. Also, when women do hold higher positions over men, the men beneath her do not always respect her the way they should and sometimes undermine her authority. We know that gender discrimination is still prevalent because of its role in the media. I have seen a number of episodes of shows that focus on the inequities women suffer from in the workplace and how they are sometimes disrespected because of their gender. I also have many male friends who are quick to come up with gender related jokes that are meant to make fun of women and say that they are inferior to men. Regardless of whether or not they really feel this way, such acts show that women are not seen as equal in today’s society no matter what laws are written. It may be the law to treat women the same as men, but there always seems to be that underlying feeling in the back of society’s mind that says that women are beneath men. I do not feel as though men are discriminated against in the workplace because they created the workplace and typically run the work place. Most people do not look at a man and think that a woman would be better qualified for a position simply because she is a woman, but that happens to women all the time. And then there is the whole debate as to whether or not we will ever see a woman president. It seems the only way this will ever be accomplished is if women band together to make it happen. I am sure that most men in this country would not be thrilled with a woman becoming president and it almost seems as though it may never happen. I would be thoroughly shocked if this happened within my lifetime solely based on the mentality of today’s society. I think the only way to change the discrimination that still prevails in today’s society is to change the way we think altogether. Discrimination will never go away unless that mentality of women not being the same goes away. It is not enough to make laws saying that women have the same opportunities as men, but people have to make a conscious effort to look past gender and look at what a person bring to the table and is able to offer.'},\n",

I was raised in a Christian home and have gone to church all my life, and homosexuality is very obviously against my religion and against what the Bible teaches. On the other hand, however, I have many good friends who are homosexual and I love them to death and would want them to be happy regardless of what I was taught to believe. So I guess I am stuck in the middle on this issue because I don’t agree or disagree with either side. Regarding the states that have legalized gay marriage, that decision is up to who ever is governor and if he legalizes it, then I see nothing wrong with that. The people who live in the state are the ones that elect these officials into office and they know beforehand where that person stands on gay marriage, therefore if a state decides to legalize it, that is their personal decision and since there is no country-wide law banning it, I don’t think that those living outside of the state have any grounds to argue. If you don’t agree with the laws of a state, then move or be an active participant in the next election so that your voice can be heard. In my opinion Bush pushing for a constitution amendment banning gay marriage is relatively understandable. Being a republican and a conservative he obviously does not agree with gay marriage so the fact that he is trying to ban it is in no way surprising to me and should not be to anyone else. Considering that America was built on having faith in God, it makes sense that the laws of the country should reflect what is written in the Bible. However, since church and state has been separated, I do not know if that is a valid argument any longer. Overall, I do not think that the federal government should be involved in the issue because I think making a nation-wide law would do more harm then help. Also, but allowing each state to make their own decisions, it gives homosexuals hope to have a legally binding relationship with the person they love and also gives them a chance to experience what people in heterosexual relationships have experienced. For me, this issue is not black and white and there is no right answer or wrong answer. I have been raised to believe one thing my entire life, and if you asked my parents or any of my church friends, they would say that gay marriage without a doubt should be illegal no questions asked, end of discussion. In all honesty, I don’t really agree with the homosexual lifestyle, but I do not judge people based on their sexual orientation. Regardless, everyone deserves the chance to be happy no matter whom they choose to love. Societal norms have changed greatly over the centuries, and it’s no surprise that they are going to continue to change, but before change happens, there is always controversy and conflict, but I guess that’s just part of the cycle.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"One of the most recent headlines involved he bipartisan Iraq Study Group, who recently published a report which emanded several things that go against Bush's agenda. The report called for a definite timetable (15 months I believe) for the complete removal of American troops from Iraqi soil, as well as direct interaction with Iran and Syria. Obviously, this group feels that the war has gone on long enough, and that it is time for the Iraqis to take the matters of their country into their own hands. There should never have been a war. President Bush invaded Iraq under false pretenses. He claimed possession of proof that Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, was in possesion of weapons of mass destruction. However, no such weapons were ever discovered. And what about the nations who actually admit to owmning nuclear weapons? Shouldn't we invade them too? Well, the U.S. can't invade itself, but what about North Korea? It seems to me that there was obviously much more behind this invasion. Bush also made this war into a war against terrorism, playing on the angry emotions still left over from the terror attacks of September 11th, 2001. But most of the terrorists came from Saudi Arabia and countries other than Iraq. I think that oil and money were the reasons for the invasion of Iraq. Bush also advocated the spread of democracy as a goal of this war. If he knew his U.S. history, he should know that almost 100 years after the Revolutionary war, the United States was still fighting against itself. Democracy takes time, and it takes even longer when it is forced upon people. So many American soldiers have died in Iraq. No more should have to die. But if the U.S. pulls out too soon, what did thousands of American soldiers die for? I think that President Bush has demonstrated several errors in judgement throughout his two terms. In his military decisions and in his appointments of advisors he has chosen quite disasterously. Therefore, I think it would be wise to follow the reccomendations of the Iraq Study Group.\"},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an email response to a someone who asked you the following: Do you feel the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?',\n",
       "   'output': \"What is the purpose of the Church? What is the role of any religious institution? I think that religion builds faith, and faith is something that becomes part of a person. The Catholic Church is a foundation for the lives of many of its members. Church doctrine and Church teachings remain a source of constancy and stability in a fast-paced, unpredictable world. The Church holds many opinions based upon these beliefs and these teachings that find a great of opposition in the 21st century. The doctrine of the Church is pro-life in all situations; it is against abortion and the death penalty. I certainly hope that these stances do not change. You see, the foundation and the heart of the Catholic Church is the teachings of Jesus, and these have endured for 2,000 years and hopefully will endure for 2,000 more. The Church interprets these teachings and applies them to the contemporary world. This is the role of the Church, a role that I do not think should change. However, The Catholic Church is so much more than doctrine. The institution of the Church, the hierarchy that governs it, is completely composed of men. This I do have a problem with. For an institution that advocates the dignity of every human person and equality among them, where is the dignity and equality within their own walls? It is important to note however, that women play a very important role on a smaller scale, in the everyday activities of individual parish communities. Because there is a lack of Catholic priests, lay people in general have taken on more religious and administrative responsibilities, and many of these lay people are women. But we cannot ignore the fact that women are not allowed to become deacons, priests, bishops, cardinals, or pope. There are several other religions that allow women to hold positions of leadership. Protestant Churches have female priests. I can only see the inclusion of women as beneficial to the Church, especially since there is such a shortage of priests. Also, I find it much harder to believe that any women would wstand by quietly while they knew a fellow male priest was sexually abusing young children. Perhaps these atrocities would have been discovered much sooner with women in some sort of position of power. Should priests be allowed to marry? The Protestant religions allow this. The Catholic Church in rare circumstances allows this. For example, if a married Protestant minister converts to Catholicism and wishes to become a priest, he is usually allowed to do so. Maybe there would be more priests if they were generally allowed to be married. But I agree with the Catholic Church on this point. A priest, and any other person who belongs to religious order, must be willing to devote his entire life in service of God and the people of the Church. I just don't think that they would be able to do that if they also had the responsibility of a family. The teachings of the Catholic Church should not adapt to the fast-paced, self-absorbed world of the 21st century. But the institution is a few decades behind in the implementation of equality between the sexes.\"},\n",

       "   'output': 'Regardless of my personal feelings about war in general, I am hard-pressed to find any legitimate political reason for the invasion of Iraq. Feeding on escalated feelings of anti-terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Bush convinced the country that Saddam Hussein was an immediate threat in possession of weapons of mass destruction who needed to be removed from power. In a most anti-constitutional fashion, Congress granted the President power to deploy troops and attack Iraq without making a formal declaration of war. (According to the Constitution, only Congress has the power to declare war, at the President’s request) The faulty planning and the poor strategy that followed created devastating effects. The number of dead American soldiers and dead Iraqis is still rising three years later. But after having been there for so long, after turning their world upside down, how can the United States abandon the Iraqi citizens now? Bush had a special word for his invasion of Iraq; he called it a pre-emptive strike – attack them before they have the chance to attack us. His administration claimed to have evidence that proved Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Based on this rationale, why hasn’t the U.S. invaded North Korea? This is a country whose government openly advertises its possession of nuclear capabilities. Yet North Korea remains untouched. After taking over Iraq, no weapons of mass destruction were actually found. And so questions arise, questions about the real motives behind the war effort. Some speculate that it was a personal vendetta, passed on from father to son. It was indeed President Herbert Walker Bush who launched the first attack against Saddam Hussein in the 1st Gulf War. Others say the reason had to do with money, and greed of the United States in its desire to control the rich oil region. U.S. troops easily overthrew the Iraqi government and scared Saddam into hiding. In the absence of government, a power vacuum formed, a vacuum for which Bush did not have a plan to effectively control. Looting and vandalism plagued the streets of Iraqi towns and villages. There was no law and no law enforcement to hold the people in check. It took time for the U.S. government to implement a democratic form of government there. If anyone knows the amount of time, struggle, and dedication it takes to establish a steady, functioning democratic government, it should be the United States, the first modern democratic nation. Nearly 100 years after its inception, the country divided itself in a bloody civil war. How could the U.S. government, backed originally by a majority of the U.S. people, imagine that a change of such magnitude would happen in Iraq in one decisive stroke? The U.S. government sent neither substantial troops nor substantial equipment. The American forces in Iraq were left insufficiently prepared to deal with the military insurgents that still linger today. Thousands upon thousands of American soldiers have died, many from unpreventable car bombs and individual suicide bombers. Part of the solution to this problem is to train local police forces, something the American troops are doing now. But this takes time and money, more time and money than the government originally planned on expending. The U.S. government, no matter how wrong it was in starting this war, now has a responsibility to the Iraqi people to finish it. The U.S. has a responsibility to leave Iraq in a state of peace and security. This is only right since peace and security is what the U.S. government took away.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The ever-advancing technology of the 21st century raises many questions about the issue of privacy. Essential to any debate over privacy rights is the knowledge that most modern means of communication are not secure. The World Wide Web and all its information is accessible to anyone. Whatever is posted on websites like Myspace or Facebook is no longer private material. Users are warned that even their emails and instant messages are accessible to others. Teachers have the same right as anyone else to browse the web, and therefore looking at a student’s myspace page is not an invasion of privacy. People who create web accounts with sites like myspace are informed of the accessibility of the site, and the publishers of the site require that its patrons acknowledge and accept this fact. If students fail to take into account the possibility of parents or teachers seeing the information that they post, it the students’ own fault. One of a school’s top priorities is the safety of its students. The faculty and administration must take care to observe and acknowledge any threats to that safety. As a student, personal privacy is much less important than general safety. This is why school officials have the right to search desks and lockers. All suspicions, accusations, and threats must be thoroughly investigated. Too much violence has taken place at schools in recent years. School is supposed to be a safe haven for children, a place where they can feel free to grow and learn. Students cannot feel this way if they live in fear. Not only is safety a top priority, but personal development of the students is very important as well. Obviously if children are exhibiting violent tendencies, there are some problems in their life and issues that need to be worked out, and may require the experienced help of teachers and counselors. My mother works in an elementary school in my town. She told me about an incident that involved several seventh graders and information posted on myspace. These students had formed a hate group targeting another student in the class. The principal found out about it, and the students responsible for creating the group were reprimanded, though I am not sure how. The principle went even further than this and called a meeting of parents to preach against the dangers of website like myspace that encourage kids to post a great deal of personal information about themselves on an unsecured, easily accessed medium. This is a necessary step to take I believe, because children need know that there are many people besides teachers who will see their myspace pages, and the consequences may be much more dangerous than detention. School is not the only place where security takes priority over privacy. The U.S. government has, many times throughout its history, limited citizens’ right to privacy in favor of national security. There is however, a very important difference with this particular school situation: by posting that bulletin on myspace, the student had no right to privacy to begin with.'},\n",

Whenever a school official receives any kind of information or indication of violence it must be investigated. The purpose of the school is to educate its students.

Therefore one of the top priorities of the school has to be safety, and this priority is vastly more important than the individual privacy rights of the students.

This is not the first time that the government has restricted the rights of its citizens to marry. Before the Civil War, American citizens could not marry slaves. But even after the Civil War, there were several state laws that banned marriage between white people and African Americans. Some of these contiued into the late 20th century.

       "   'output': 'It’s difficult for someone of my limited knowledge to come to a decisive conclusion about the use of marijuana. The nature and effects of alcohol are more frequently addressed and explained for public knowledge than those of other narcotics. Before my first semester at Loyola started, I was required to complete a three hour course of alcohol education. This course included several tests and surveys. I was never informed about the possible damaging effects of marijuana, although I can say from experience that its illegal usage certainly rivals the illegal consumption of alcohol. In the process of deciding on the legality of marijuana, it is helpful to examine the nature and the effects of other legal substances such as alcohol and cigarettes. Several scientific studies have proven that alcohol, when consumed in a moderate fashion, can be beneficial to one’s health. Doctors have found that marijuana has certain health benefits as well. It helps relieve pain for patients who suffer from such chronic diseases as multiple sclerosis. Despite the advantages of medicinal use, I do not know of any positive effects that marijuana may have on a typical, relatively healthy person. I do, however, remember reading an article in Time magazine about the detriments it poses to such a person’s health. Marijuana can impair the cognitive memory and cause damage to short-term memory. And of course, smoking in general, whether it is cigarettes or marijuana, harms the lungs. Cigarettes continue to be legal for those over a certain age even after years of research and countless studies have revealed their extremely harmful effects. I will not list all of them here but the most detrimental to a smoker’s health is the high risk of developing lung cancer. And in the worst cases, the cancer kills them. Unlike alcohol, cigarettes posses no redeeming health benefits when consumed in moderation. Marijuana shares this lack, so is it unfair that marijuana is illegal while smoking is not? There are many who claim that the legalization of marijuana, according to strict distribution and consumption laws, would help to combat illegal drug trafficking. This is a naïve viewpoint to take. If the production and sale of marijuana is removed from the hands of drug traffickers (which will be a difficult task in itself), there are a myriad of other drugs for them to choose from. The only way that the government has a chance of ending the trafficking of illegal drugs is to make all narcotics legal. I can understand the reasons why people think that marijuana should not be illegal. But I am not aware of any valid reasons why people think that marijuana should be legal. The recreational use of marijuana offers not health benefits but definite health hazards. Not only does marijuana threaten the health of the user, but its effects on the user may directly affect others in negative ways as well.'}],\n",

Third, if marijuana were legal, there would be much less crime. In Amsterdam, where marijuana is legal to a certain extent, crime is almost nonexistent.

No person would ever voluntarily submit themselves to the pain and anguish a homosexual and his or her family inevitably goes through when that person finally “comes out of the closet.” This pain is caused by the media and its everyday assistance in painting an embarrassing picture of homosexuals in general. Therefore, no person holds the right to label a couple’s love for one another as wrong simply because both members of the couple are of the same sex. Furthermore, the Federal government should have no say regarding a couple’s right to marriage. Marriage is neither a legal nor moral concern, nor is it a matter of national security. It is a right that any two people should have to graft their lives together in a beautiful act of love for one another.

I have a personal interest in marijuana being legalized. A majority of my close and lasting friendships, from high school through to college, began, or were nurtured, through a common bond: marijuana. I’ve met a lot of people after someone asks the question, “hey, want to smoke?” Some might consider this shallow, and my friendships unhealthy, but the reality is, I’ve never met a group of people as close as my friends. We’ve stuck together through break ups and people moving away, through college and fights. I can go to any of my close friends for advice on anything, and we can talk intelligently about sports, politics, philosophy, and a whole number of things. If given the chance, we could certainly disprove many misconceptions people may have about youth who smoke marijuana. Marijuana should be legalized because its affects are similar, and probably milder, than those of alcohol. Marijuana cannot directly kill you, unlike alcohol. And although I have not personally driven stoned, many of my friends do so on a regular basis and have never once encountered any problems. Marijuana is a social drug, just like alcohol. My best friendships have been born from a common interest: smoking pot.

       "   'output': 'I believe that gender discrimination is absolutely still an issue in the United States today. A few years back, I was writing a paper, and as research, I wad required to find the mean salaries for white men and white women. The difference was jarring: even though our higher academic institutions are now more female than male, white men still made an average of $10,000 more a year than white females ($40,000 to $30,000) the difference between black men and black women is also $10,000 dollars, $30,000 to $20,000). Thus, even though more women are getting degrees than men, it means that either men are making more for the same jobs, or that men are holding more higher paying jobs than women- and a quick glance into a corporate board room across the country will tell you that the latter is most definitely true. Another area where it is easy to see gender discrimination against females is in the ongoing debate about whether or not Hilary Clinton has what it takes to be the next president. Almost every article is prefaced with the question “is America ready for a woman president?” There mere fact that this question has to be asked is a pretty glaring example of very blatant gender discrimination. The insinuation, of course, is that a woman brings something different, something perhaps inferior, to the table than a man does. Of course, discrimination can certainly swing both ways. There are certain professions that men still get strange looks for taking. You don’t see many male hairdressers, or many male nurses (the movie “Meet The Parents”) comes to mind when Robert DeNiro makes fun of Ben Stiller’s character for being a male nurse). If anyone admits to being a hairdresser or a male nurse, he’ll often be asked, well, why? And there’s always an underlying insinuation that maybe, he’s gay- which, of course, in our culture is emasculating. Gender discrimination is alive and well in America. It’s seen in the discrepancy in salaries between men and women, it’s seen in the popularity of men’s sports over women’s sports, and it’s seen in the fact that this country has not had, in 200 years, a single serious female candidate for president- even though many European countries have long since had female presidents or prime ministers. There are cases, too, of male discrimination, but the issue is much less serious, and often comes from jobs that are viewed as too “feminine.”'},\n",

But for some reason we as a culture are sitting back and allowing our president to use the bible as the reason why same sex marriages should not be allowed in our country. I was a member of SAGABA in high school, which stands for the straight and gay and bisexual alliance, I met some of the most passionately in love men and women I know. So what if they were in love with members of the same sex, love is love is love no matter what the sexual orientation is. Does the idea of a man and a man living together really still scare our country? The topic of homosexuality has been raised in the media, on our reality television shows, and even with our very own vice president. When a show called the real world has seven cast members and every season at least one member is gay, doesn’t that say something about “the real world,” or at least how our society perceives it. Gay parents are perfectly capable of providing a safe and proper home for raising a child. It is my belief that an adopted son or daughter can flourish just the same with same sex parents as he or she would in a traditional household. If the love is real than the sexual preference should mean nothing. Our President holds his high Christian morals in very high regard. Undoubtedly growing up in Texas our president most likely had a slightly slanted impression of homosexuals. I know I am stereotyping a state an to be honest just a region of our country in general, but its tough for a southerner to see eye to eye with per say somebody from California or Massachusetts. There should in no way be a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. The constitution lays the constructs on how to make our country a safe and efficiently run democracy. It does not tell us who to marry or what is moral. The constitution is not the bible and it does not contain “God’s word.” Therefore our president needs to stop quoting the bible as his reason for being so opposed to same sex marriage. I do not care one way or another if the bible describes marriage as between a man and a woman. Not every American is Christian and not every American is straight. If certain states want to ban gay marriage then legally there is no recourse to stop them. On the same hand if a state, such as California wants to legalize gay marriage they too should be able to do so. To make such a controversial issue with no clear cut conclusion into a federal law would be premature and unfair to a great percentage of accepting Americans.'},\n",

For me it has been an open forum for meeting friends at my school, getting in tough with old high school friends, and of course maybe grabbing a screen name or a phone number of the cute girl that sits next to me in class. However, last year one of my friends was suspended for one game of his lacrosse season because in one of his facebook pictures he was holding a beer and he is not of the age. How did he get in trouble? Our athletic director has a facebook account under some fake name and decided to check my friend’s pictures. This is an invasion of privacy on multiple levels. First of all he is using a false identity to look at pictures of college students he knows performing illegal deeds after the fact. The police couldn’t even have arrested my friend for drinking but our AD can suspend him. Moreover, where is the line to be drawn? Our lives are already monitored to a heartbeat here at Loyola, we are given luxurious apartments along with freedom from our parents for the first time in our lives, and then immediately reprimanded by RA’s and prick resident directors for entertaining the idea of beer before we are 21. That all being said I am in favor of finding out about a bomb threat through myspace.com. As far as I am concerned if it saves lives it is alright by me. That doesn’t mean I want my house to be wire tapped. But if I had written on my front lawn that I am going to bomb a building than it would be ok to do some fly by surveillance. Our government’s role is to protect and to serve its citizens, not to be overbearing and intrusive. It is my belief that our president should have been impeached for his role in the wire tapping of certain American citizens following the terror attacks on 9/11. It is just sad that our privacy had to be impinged upon as retaliation for our government not being informed enough about the acts that lead up to 9/11. In our schools, privacy should be permitted to a certain degree where a principals or a deans discretion being used to make final decisions. Lockers and emails should be accessible for investigation if need be, but under no circumstances should our phone conversations be recorded. Myspace and facebook transcend both phone and email conversations. They are open forums for freedom of speech for my generation.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'I absolutely feel as though the Catholic Church has to change its ways in order to adapt to the 21st century. Two major issues come to my mind when I think of the Catholic Church; those issues are Gay marriage and abortion. I am a very liberal person and I see eye to eye with many of the political views held my leftist in the political world. Thus I believe that gays should be allowed to marry just as any other couple that is in love should have the right to marriage and obviously I also believe that women should have the choice to abort a pregnancy should the circumstance present itself. The church does not believe that either should be allowed and its justification comes from religious doctrine that was given or written for us thousands of years ago. I don’t want to seem like I am mooching the church but to be honest things change drastically in a matter of decades let alone in a matter of centuries. We have the proper medical procedures to perform abortions with out harming the women. Furthermore, to quote church doctrine that is older than time, and say that a man can not marry another man because in the bible it says that marriage is between a man and a women is preposterous. In the biblical times if somebody were to come out and pronounce there homosexuality they could be subject to blood letting or a lobotomy, you know to get the “gay out of them.” Heck if you want to go back even further there are numerous written accounts of homosexual acts within the Spartan male communities as well as with in the Greek schools for men. Older Spartans would regularly engage in acts of homosexuality with younger Spartans and it was perfectly permissible. This leads me right into my next topic which would be older clergy men, specifically priests over stepping their bounds and engaging in sexual acts with younger church going boys. What is the difference between Sparta and the churches in Boston where Priests were raping boys? In Sparta it was part of the culture, in America it is a clear act of rape preformed by a priest that is sexually uneasy due to years of celibacy and perhaps in many cases unrequited love. The Catholic Church needs to start to allow their priests to marry. It may seem ridiculous due to centuries of church rule against it, however, a married sexually fulfilled priest could perform his job just as well as a celibate one, and without the worry of perhaps raping a boy. Rabbi’s and ministers of all other religions are permitted to marry and live normal lives all the while devoting themselves to their work and their God. Along the same lines, women are also allowed to be Rabbi’s and Ministers, to not allow women to be Catholic Priests is a major gender discrimination that our country has overlooked for far too long. It is time for the Church to meet the times, steps need to be taken to modernize what is now becoming an outdated major religious movement.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'I am firm believer that the United States should have never embarked on any type of military intervention in Iraq. I have always looked at war as a last resort. If a genocide needs to be stopped, or a dictator needs to have his hand taken away from the nuclear button, then in certain situations war is the only logical outcome. That being said I agreed with our involvement in WWII and I would have been in agreement with any military assistance we could have provided during the Rwandan genocide that the Caucasian world never lost sleep over. But Iraq, Iraq to me was a country ruled by an iron fist dictator that we installed when it was politically correct to do so in the early 1980’s. Before we knew it our little Seddam had emerged from his puppet role as foe to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran was now himself the most feared dictator in the Middle East. Our foreign policy mistake almost thirty years ago has not lead to not one but now two wars in Iraq, and perhaps even worse our occupation can now be seen as holding up the infrastructure of a nation divided. It is tough for me as an American voter with liberal political ideologies to not feel lied to by our government. We have perpetuated the colonialist ways of nation building though big corporations. Dick Chaney’s own company Halliburton is rebuilding the rubble that used to be called Iraq, furthermore, pip lines through Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern countries are still flowing as planned. To me Iraq was a smoke screen that ended up accidentally blinding the ones using it for cover. There were no weapons of mass destruction only a brutal dictator that we as a country have shared intimate ties with for decades. We should be out of Iraq as soon as possible. The casualties, the expenses, and the Iraqi people, all need to be taken into account at this point. Iraq is more dangerous today than it has ever been, and now our great nation may be directly responsible for that. This war has gone on longer than anyone had originally anticipated. What was once a war backed by many UN involved countries is now a matter of US versus the world. With Seddam in custody and literally all of his top officials dead or also captured Iraq should now have the means to begin to start over, without our help. As long as we are involved with their elections and their economy, they will never be a free country. Perhaps the new dictator of Iraq is George W. Bush.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'In the recent cited event where police officers were able to stop a school shooting because of information on myspace I believe they were correct in their actions. First and foremost, the law enforcers of this country have a duty to protect all citizens and uphold the law. With that in mind, I feel their actions were motivated by this cause and none other. They did have to cross so-called “privacy boundaries” to do this, however, the issue of privacy in this case is irrelevant. Any of the major facilitators (Facebook, myspace, etc…) of personal information on the World Wide Web these days make the information fairly public to a large number of people; the users merely need, at most, a password and username. Sometimes those two pieces of information are not even required, as in the case of myspace. So if there is no restriction or attempt to protect the community of users with some sort of agreement or set of log-in standards, it is unreasonable to call the information on the myspace wall private. If the information is that easy to obtain, there are not any privacy attributions associated with it. In a moral debate about what is more important to society, privacy or human life, it is still hard to uphold the fact that privacy comes first and should be respected. When it boils down to the fundamental nature of human society, life is invaluable and should be preserved at all costs. The fact that people would revolt against law enforcement’s “improper” use of information when it saved potentially many innocent lives is nothing less than appalling. Had the specific situation described, or any other situation for that matter, gone through and progressed according to plan the general consensus would probably be to support the use of private information. I think without the reality of information’s effect on other people, one would tend to favor a more theoretical argument, such as privacy rights in this situation. If school shootings were to occur, however, the general reasoning would probably change to consent to usage of private information in the case where human harm can be prevented. The idea of privacy rights in the case of myspace pertains to information that is available to the general population on the World Wide Web. With such easy and unhindered access to the information, it is hard to maintain a case for privacy rights when the sole purpose is to share your information with others. Again, it is especially hard to maintain the case for privacy rights when that information contains threats to human safety. The real issues that may stem from the idea of privacy rights on the World Wide Web are rights in other aspects of life: phone conversations, personal credit information, and personal physical property among many others. In my mind privacy rights become a much larger issue, especially recently where the government has been acting controversially to inspect possible homeland security issues, when the information is not generally available to the public or is not meant to be generally available to the public. When phones are being tapped or personal correspondences are being intercepted where communication is meant to exist privately between small groups of people, privacy rights are being broken in my opinion.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The states that have legalized gay marriage are more humane, and thus right on the issue. It is not the business of any state, government, or otherwise to interfere with the loving relationship between two humans. Governments were established in the best interest of the citizens and to ensure justice; since when did the governments make it their business to impede on the social and private lives of the citizens when it comes to what relationships they can or can not legally have. Scientifically speaking, it has been proven that men or women who are homosexual are born with this tendency or desire. As far as this pertains to the church, if it is their belief that God is the creator of human life thus making it sacred, then there is further fault in their stance on gay marriage. If God creates all humans, even the ones with homosexual tendencies as a part of their genealogical structure, then they too deserve the sacred bonds that God has made in marriage for his human creations. As far as the federal government’s involvement in the issue, it is completely and utterly wrong. The government has no right to govern such a diverse country on religious issues. When there are Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the same country, there is no justifiable way for them to back any law on a strictly conservative Christian stance. Religion is certainly not a science and is extremely subjective in its interpretation, so for the government to use it as a means to support something like the banning of gay marriage is impractical and demoralizing to their credibility. The way families are constructed in more recent history has changed a great deal, and this is just one more example of the Christian Church’s need to modernize. Science has brought fourth evidence of a person’s genealogical structure that shows they have sexual preference encoded in their DNA. It would suit the church best to respect the new findings of science and change their view accordingly. The family can still flourish and the same love can evolve out of homosexual set of parents. Adoption and new ways of creating offspring such as invitro fertilization or surrogate motherhood have made families possible for homosexual parents. If they can legally create a family in one of the aforementioned manners and can still provide for the family in the same way heterosexual parents could, then certainly family life is no reason to ban gay marriage. If the problem with legalizing gay marriage has to do with Christian approval, then the state can call the bond something such as “civil bond.” The government has no business tying its policies to religion in the first place, but if that is a thought that perhaps there should be a state-sanctioned name that grants the marriage as a legal action from the state or country, as opposed to a religion. This route would ensure there remains a separation from church and state and gay marriage could flourish as an act of a free country and not a behind-the-times religion.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The war in Iraq, while aimed at respectable purpose has drawn on for too long and has become detrimental to the United States of America as well as the citizens of Iraq. The aim of the war, on the surface anyway, is to enable to people of Iraq to escape the reigns of a harsh tyrannical ruler and experience the freedom and liberation of a democratic government. Some feel, and I tend to think there is a hint of truth in this assumption, that George Bush’s involvement in the war stems at least partly from an ongoing family feud between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. The war should have ceased after the ruler was taken from power and other insurgents and accomplices of the reign were effectively removed from their positions. The war seems to have run on aimlessly at this point, forgetting the purpose, and failing to empower the people of Iraq. There comes a point when the Iraqi citizens need to take power back for themselves, and I think that point has come and gone. The United States is seeming less and less like a helpful friend to Iraq and more and more like a force on a wild, uncontrolled path towards making some political statement world-wide. Even back in the United States the war seems to cause nothing but negative effects economically and socially. Soldier after soldier is dying for what has become a useless and drawn out cause. It is ridiculous to think that the perpetual nature of the war is a just trade for the lives of American soldiers. The point has been made that we want to spread democracy, and certainly there is great truth and cause in that pursuit. The war, however, made that point a long time ago and now more and more soldiers continue to lose their lives. Economically speaking, this war has cost the country billions and billions of dollars. There are certainly more worthy causes for our country’s money on the home soil. Poverty is one example of war we are trying to fight on our home turf right now, and that eighteen billion or so dollars that has been spent on the war would go a long way to aid those in need here. We are spending an excess of money on foreign soil to aid foreign citizens when there are American who need help from all of those funds. I do believe the spread of democracy is a just pursuit but, as I have mentioned, that purpose has long since been declared, achieved, and passed. Democracy back in our own country calls for the aid of millions in poverty, and their cries should not go unnoticed because that is part of the democratic system. The other issue with the war in Iraq is the prioritization it was given over the war on terrorism. Saddam Hussein was not the one that attacked our country and killed thousands of our citizens on September 11, 2001. If we are to pursue any type of war our efforts would be more just when aimed at the end to terrorism.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"The side that has banned gay marriage is wrong for many reasons. Governments originally came to be to protect man and enforce a basic set of moral laws so that safety could florish. The governments today, waging such issues as gay marriage, have long since over-stepped their bounds. Marriage, no matter what, is characterized by love and if two human beings, regardless of gender, love each other then the marriage is one hundred percent justified. The government should have a role in protecting its citizens but this is a case of impedance where the government is taking away that right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If the Church wishes to ban that marriage, so be it, their views are very much outdated as it is. There is no reason that a society should ban a legal bond between two gay spouses because they have every right as human beings to pursue a life that they see fit. Of all sectors of the government, the Federal government is the last one who should step in if the government should even be able to ban such a thing. To say that an entire country of people, billions of people, can not legally be in love in this territory is completely close-minded and stands against all this country was founded on. The United States has come to stand for a place where people can be themselves and live a life of freedom; and here is George Bush trying to take all of those promises of this great country away from the citizens. Furthermore, there has been scientific data showing that people with homosexual tendencies are born with those tendencies. To try and govern something so natural, something people are born with in their genetic coding, is unnatural and unjustified. We do not ban people with disabilities from part of society just because they were born that way. Each and every person in this country and on this planet is unique and was born with unique traits and characteristics. A government filled with conservative, like-minded, and ignorant people should not have the ability to make something illegal when it is part of an individual's genetic make-up and personal choice.\"},\n",

If our true purpose, as the United States, was to help Iraq restore a Democratic government then the cause, in my eyes, was completely justified. For whatever reason there are countries in the world that have fallen in to regimes that inflict a great deal of unjust power on their citizens and the regime, over time, has been enforeced and engrained in to the society so that it is very hard to break or even see that it is wrong anymore. The United States was completey right in starting the war and helping to break down the tyranny so the citizens could experience a more liberating government. If, however, the government chose to go to war in Iraq for more personal reasons dealing with President Bush's family history with Sadam Hussein, then it was completely unjustified. There is no reason that an entire country should go to war and spend numerous resources for a cause that stems back to personal bad blood between two men. There are far better uses to our country's resources than a war for unjust personal reasons. Since we have already gotten our point across that we wanted to spread democracy, I believe our retreat has been long since overdue. The point has been made and we are now wasting precious resources on foreign soil. We are having problems with our social security system, poverty, and many other things on our own soil, yet we are spending billions of dollars to fight a war that has lost any sort of meaning or purpose.

       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this?',\n",
       "   'output': 'The recent legalization of small amounts of marijuana to users 21 years and older has certainly sparked much debate. I believe that its effects are similar enough that it should be made legal. There have been numerous tests and studies performed to assess the consequences of marijuana smoking versus cigarette smoking, and the differences between the two are not that great. When compared with alcohol both, in moderation, provide a very similar obstacle to the senses. The fact that marijuana has been made legalized in small amounts seems legitimate enough because most of the harmful effects, like many other drugs, have been proven to exist after long-term, frequent use. The fact of the matter is that any of these drugs are not extremely life-threatening or detrimental to one’s mental development when used in moderation. In moderation the effects are minimal and can be contained. With marijuana, however, as with any drug such as alcohol and cigarettes the effects increase exponentially under frequent, long-term use. The decision to make marijuana legal in small amounts could also help lower the crime-rate and keep the money for the product in the city’s economy (as opposed to the black market). When a desired product is made legal it cuts the amount of black market deals and crime associated with the product. This is so because it is no longer illegal to perform the actions so the desire can still be fulfilled without the illegal attribution. Of course there will still be crime associated with the use and selling of marijuana just because it was not completely legalized, but a percentage will be cut out as those occasional and moderate users can be satisfied legally. Recognizing the relative safety of the drug in moderation, Denver can also make a positive economic boost. Since the sale of the good became legalized, the government can now associate taxes with the good and sales may increase since there is a greater ease of acquiring the marijuana. While taxes may hinder some from the purchase as opposed to the black market purchases, I think it would prove better for the majority of those in the market. Even with taxes, the actual purchase is much easier, convenient, and without legal risk. The only problem I see from legalizing the marijuana in small amounts is how they are actually controlling the amounts being sold to customers. One customer, as I understand the situation, could theoretically obtain a small amount from several different retailers making a rather large portion for that individual. This would cause a problem as the idea of moderation is pushed aside and the marijuana can cause serious brain and respiratory problems in the long run. Overall, I think the city got the age right by not likening the substance to cigarettes, but rather alcohol. I think the effects are much closer to alcohol, even those some of the health side effects are repeated with cigarettes. As far as mind alteration, it would seem that marijuana and alcohol are closer. My educated guess of the average age for marijuana users in the United States is probably about 18, so with a higher legal age, the government is still giving this choice for moderation to those more responsible for the usage.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'The Catholic Church definitely needs to change its ways to adapt to the 21st Century. Over the course of time the Church officials have blindly enforced traditions of the Catholic history to aim at, but not obtains, a higher means of humanity; a humanity where virtues such as humility and service, among others, flourish in a harmonious mankind. While their aims may provide virtuous characters, virtuous because they are working towards such a high good and their actions along the way are thus better, the end is far from realistic. Some of the means by which to obtain this good are also unrealistic in contemporary society. Back in history, groups of people could and were pressure to use a good amount of their time for worship and the furthering of their own spirituality through religion. Today’s world presses individuals to lead much more busy and multi-focused lives where it is hard to put so much focus, time, and devotion in to one practice. Some of the Protestant churches, while stressing its importance, do not require a strict attendance schedule for all followers. The Catholic Church is fairly strict about its once-a-week requirement to worship and this can be hard to accomplish today. Additionally it seems as though this time where people should go to look for further spiritual development outside their everyday life is made empty and meaningless as it becomes a monotonous series of routines aimed at a blind goal. Another area where the Catholic Church needs to bring its views in to the contemporary society is science. Many of the teachings and viewpoints on the church obviously came very early on in history; starting around 2000 years ago and going up through the middle of the second millennium. During this time there was little explanation for unnatural occurrences, and even some natural occurrences, other than the supernatural. Now with ever-evolving scientific theories, methods, and technologies, numerous parts of the natural world are now explainable and comprehensible. One example of science clashing with religion is evolution. The church has the view where everything was created by God with the creation stories in Genesis. Science, in recent times, has provided more and more convincing evidence towards the idea of evolution, or the idea that organisms modified their very being over time to survive better in their environments. The Catholic Church is becoming very dated its strict beliefs and understandings of the world. The Church needs to begin to broaden its perspective as scientific evidence and new technology gives us a greater understanding and means to explain the word around us. The Church needs to open up more to increased medical sophistication and medical technology, especially as it pertains to the preservation of human life. If the Church truly has the mindset that God put us on the Earth to enjoy his creation then why not also accept the means he gave us to live by and enhance our own lives. I think sometimes the Church forgets that God gave us our minds which support and create all these new ideas and scientific knowledge which can help mankind.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'Gay marriage has become a strong issue in the United States today. Everyone seems to have an opinion on the issue. Personally, I believe that Gay marriage should be completely legalized in the United States. Some states have legalized this, where as some states want to completely ban it. Currently, President Bush is trying to propose an amendment that will ban gay marriage. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. Who gives our government the right to say who we can and cannot marry? The only restriction that heterosexual couples have regarding marriage is the age: you must be 18. Why should homosexual couples be faced with any more restrictions? It is wrong to say that two people who are in love are not able to get married, no matter what their sexual preference is. There are two people and they have fallen in love. They care about each other, and are looking to get married and start a family. They want a wedding to show their friends and family that they are devoted to each other and for legal reasons. Married couples have rights when it comes to legal issues for their spouse. These seem like pretty normal reasons to want to be married. So why does it matter if these people are men and women, men and men, or women and women? There was a case in the news recently where a lesbian was in the hospital on life support. Her parents were there and so was her partner. Her parents wanted to end her life; they felt that she should not be living on life support. However, her partner knew that she would have wanted to try to live on machines, but because there was no legal tie between the two women, her partner had no rights. How is that fair? In many cases homosexual couples are still able to adopt children. These family styles are becoming more and more common in our society. If a couple is allowed to have a child, why should they not be able to be married? No one stands in the way of heterosexual couples. Right now I could find a heterosexual partner and walk into a courthouse or a chapel in Las Vegas. With little difficulty I would be able to marry this heterosexual partner. But if I wanted a homosexual marriage, forget it. There are such ridiculous views held by people in our country against homosexuality. Very few homosexuals are trying to push their views onto you; they would just like to be able to live their lives normally. Studies have been conducted that say being homosexual may be genetic. So how would you like it if you were born with brown hair (another genetic trait) and you were not able to get married? It doesn’t seem so fair when we look at it that way. Passing an amendment that would ban gay marriages seems like such a drastic move. Why should our country be so biased against citizens that are equal to us? In the United States we have the same rights; we have freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, the freedom of press. This should be no different.

In the past it was discrimination for very large issues, women were not allowed to vote, or hold a job. But there are also stereotypical beliefs held by both genders that are not completely extinct. When some men look at women all they see is “Suzie homemaker.” There is a stereotype of women that they belong in the kitchen, meant for nothing else then taking care of the house and the family. But this is not at all true. Women are just as capable as men to work and make money to support their families. However, there is discrimination in the workplace too. You have heard the story many times. A woman is at work and is not taken as seriously as the men that she works with. Even if she holds the same position as a male co-worker her education isn’t good enough, or her presentation couldn’t possibly be as good as a man’s work. Women have come such a long way. Although never faced with completely equal opportunities, our mothers and grandmothers took great strides in making life better for all women. It is now not unusual for women to work, as well as take care of a family. Women are powerful and can do anything they set their minds to. Women should be awarded all the same opportunities as men without restrictions. Not to be biased, men are faced with gender discriminations. Throughout history men have been referred to as the “bread winner” of the family, whose only job was to go to work and make the money. Taking care of family issues was not in the job description. However, times have changed. Now there are many men, who are referred to as “Mr. Mom”, taking care of the children, the housecleaning, and the family. Men as well as women can be in charge of these responsibilities. There shouldn’t be these stereotypes facing both genders that undermine what they want to do with their lives. More then just work related stereotypes there are others facing both genders. Women are seen as the weaker gender, the gender that is not as capable as the men. Men are seen as the less emotional, less sensitive gender. Although in some cases these stereotypes are true, it is unfair to label all of one gender as having specific traits. So what can we do about this problem? What can we do to change it? I don’t know if there is much we can do as an individual. For just one person to try and change discrimination would be a monumental task. But the power of a group is often underestimated. This is how women originally won the rights that they share now. Many women in the 1920’s were part of protests, picket lines, shouting “Votes for women.” They fought for their equal rights. The stereotypes we face now, although not a gigantic feat to overcome as winning the right to vote was, are still very important. Together if a group were to come together they would have a greater chance of getting something accomplished.'},\n",

There are many men today who still feel that women belong \"in the kitchen.\" Many times it is said in a joking way, but there is still some sense of truth to it in their minds. In the workplace, men often feel that women are not good enough, and are not able to accomplish the same things that they are. Women are looked at as sexual beings and not much more. However, many men have seen discrimination too. The idea of \"Mr.Mom\", a stay at home dad with a woman as the main source of income is not at all uncommon, but still men who choose this as their profession are ridiculed.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'I believe that the Catholic Church does need to change its ways. With many issues, the Church is bound in the ways of the bible. The bible, being written many years ago does not take into account new ways of thinking. Priests have many rules they need to obey. They are not allowed to be married; they are seen as being married to the Church. In many other religions the holy men are allowed to be married and still serve their faith. I don’t think there would be much of a change if priests were allowed to have a wife. Their devotion to their faith would not be changed. Having a family and a wife does not mean you cannot still serve in your job. Look at all other professions; all the men and women who hold jobs are still able to have a family if they want to. The church should be no different. A family does not change a devotion to faith. Having female priests would also be a positive change for the church. Since the founding of the Catholic Church, priests have been required to be male. But what is the difference? Why is a man a better fit for a holy man? I don’t understand what the difference would be; a female could hold the same devotion as a male. Now we need to take into account the recent acts of pedophilia involving priests in the Catholic Church. I do not believe that this act would have been change if priests were allowed to be married. These terrible acts happen even now all over the country. Not always with priests, but with other men who think this is a good idea. Allowing priests to marry would not have changed how they acted. They acted inappropriately and should be punished. The Catholic Church holds many strong views on issues that are currently being discussed in our world. On the issue of sex, the Church believes in abstinence until marriage, and do not condone any other form of birth control. Although this is the view that most would hope is being followed, this is not the case. Many people who have yet to be married are having sexual relations. Isn’t it more important to help the health and well being of the people involved? Now that our society has altered views on this issue, isn’t it time for our church to follow? The same goes with the topic of gay marriage and gay rights in general. The Catholic Church holds strong disapproval of gay marriage. This has become an immense issue in our society which is involving government in making the final decision, but the Church should look into learning more about the issue to try and accept it. The Church should be a place where you can come to feel one with god, no matter what your sexual preference is. The Catholic Church has to make some changes to catch up to the 21st century. Many strides have been made in other branches of life in the United States but the church is one place that has never changed.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'When it comes to gender discrimination, I do feel that it is still present in socitey. It is something that has been going on from the very begining of time, and I am not really sure if it will ever compleatly go away. When women finally got the vote here in the USA, it was after the African Amaricans, wich is ironic being we had the whole civil war going on at one point trying to argue that they should be kept as slaves (wich we rightly judged that they should not, and i am glad of this fact!) However, women, even though they were white were not allowed to vote until after the african american men could. Actually, white and african american women were lumped together in this case in that neither were allowed to vote untin the 1920s at the same time. With this bit of history, we have clearly come a long ways, yet there is still many things that keep women down. There is the theory of the \"glass roof\" in some jobs, were women can only be premoted so high, and then can never really get to the full top because the men in society or even the views of other women keep them down. It is getting to be a little more common to see women in the top positions, yet most CEO\\'s or Bosses are still the men. I being a woman would like to think that I can rais up into the career of my choice as far as I would like to go without any bounderies. I would like to feel and think that in these positions or in any position that I might have or obtain, I would be respected just as much as a male would. It is here that we come to our first problem. Women are still often thought of as the parent that should stay at home and raise the children and shoule be under the rull of the man of the house. Or at least this used to be the majority of thinking. Now a new type of gender discrimination I feel is starting to evolve, and it does not have to deal with women under men, but women against women. It is now starting to be that if you are a mom, it is not enough. You should not only rais a family, cook, and take care of them, but you should also be involved in clubs, activities and have a part time job. If you are not able to fullfill all of these requiremnets, some women are looking down on those that dont and feel that because they are they are better and more supirior. It is an odd concept, but ture. I guess it is the balencing of a sacle really. As soon as women start to gain acceptance into a male dominated society, other women start to look down on you if you are not taking every opportunity that one can. THis is not just in teh united states that i see this but streaching accross the ocean to the UK as well. Men are also discriminated against when it is the wife in the family who seems to be the one who is earning the money. A father should be respected for staying at home and taking care of his family if that is what they choose to do, yet ofthen stay at home fathers are looked down upon, wich is sad. ONe should not be judged for what they do if it is nobel, such as taking care of thier children and family. Do I see any way of changing these prejucices? Unfortunaly not overnight, but I feel only time will tell what happens next.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"1. LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this? Do you feel that marijuana and its effects are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legal? I do not really know how I feel about the legalization of marijuana. On the one hand I have heard that studies have come out proving that alcohol is actually more harmful the pot. Under alcohol, one loosed much their inhibition and many a persons have made extremely bad judgment calls because of this. I know personally of friends who have blacked out, gotten sick, and have even had sex when they didn't mean to, all because of alcohol. I am not saying that this can not happen and does not happen with the use of weed, but I have not heard it to this extent. I also know that people can get addicted to alcohol if they are not careful, and can eventually get cirrhosis of the liver. This is a serious problem because then people have to have a liver replacement, which can take a long time to receive because of the weighting list. If they do not receive one soon enough, they death is the only other answer. Again, I have not heard of this happening with the use of marijuana, but I am not ruling it out, I have just never heard of it. I do know, that from when I have seen other people use it that they tend to act really goofy, or settle down and just sit there. I also know that just from talking with people over time that I am in contact with who do use it frequently, they do not seem to be as sharp as they used to be. I am not really sure if there has been any significant case study of this, but I feel that it tends to kill of brain cells. I would have to do more research though, before I came to any conclusions about the drug. On a different lever outside of actually using it, I do feel that it should be legalized, because that way the government can monitor it. There are so many drug wars and gangs on the streets because of this drug, and there would be a lot less death in the inner cities because it would no longer be an underground market. Also, but regulating it, people would be sure to be getting the actual real pure substance, verses just filler or even poison mixed in with it. Another reason why it should be legalized is because it would help to get rid of the drug war outside of the United States, namely Mexico. Mexico has some of the biggest and cruelest drug lords in all of the pot selling business. Marijuana is actually a big cash selling crop, and the drug lords monitor who grows it and how much of the crop is sold, so much so that if something is messed up along the way, of if they find someone growing it/and or selling it who should not be, then bloodshed it often the only answer. With the legalization of marijuana, these drug lords would loose a huge part of their business, because we would be able to grow the crop on our own soil, and it would no longer be illegal, so many of the workers in Mexico for the drug lords would loose their jobs. There would be no need for smugglers anymore. So again, for these reason I am not sure if pot should be legalized or not.\"},\n",

People who sighn up for those particular type of websites know that it is open to the public and that anyone can search of you and find out informatino. It is actually a bit scary if you think about it, because now that society has become so digitalized we are all leaving traces or ourselves or footprints out in cyberspace that can be easily tracked by just about anyone. One has to realize that anything that is done on a computer and put on the internet is liable to be there forever in some form or another and is able to be looked at or viewed by almost anyone. That is why it is called the World Wide Web. It streaches accross contenents to everywere. In regardes to other pricavy laws, such as the tapping of phone conversatinos and phone lines, i do not necissarily like this idea, but i do realize that it is for our protection. I dont really feel like I have anything to really worry about, because honestly if some governmental agency were to listen in to my converstation randomly they would be very dissappointed because most of my conversatinos are quite silly and have not content about polotics or anything of that matter. I like it that they are able to stop people from commiting crimes though, just by listening to people talk. ON the other hand, this idea is very creepy. It is almost like that whole \"big brother\" \"father\\' thing of the story 1984 by George Orwell. Basically anything one does is monitored and I dont really like the idea of people listeing to my conversations to my mom or to friends. Yes I feel like it is an invasion of privacy, and I wish it did not have to be done. I feel like it used to be that only if certain words poped up in a sentence, such as \"bomb, war, terrorist, presiden, etc.\" then your conversation would be monitored. I am not sure if that is how it quite works now. FOr the patriot act, bacically it is just a freindly name to help disguise what its true funcion is....to take away more or our privacy and freedoms, yet while I know this I am afraid to say that i am a bit rusty on what the details of this act are. I just know that it sounds friendly and helpful and in reality it is not as nice as it seems. When it comes to the safty of others though, going back to the school, I do not think that there really sould be any line drawn. The school shooter could have killed many lives, and with what just happened at VT last year, I would be more then happy if any school shooters were caught beforhand. THere are some rights that we should just accept as given, and some we should take as gifts but realize that people are going to monitor them to keep us safe. I feel that as long as this last part...to keep us safe....is kept in this strick regards, then we should be fine, but we need to make sure that the government or school officials do not go too power hungry.'},\n",

       "   'output': \"Subject Number 15: 3. PRIVACY RIGHTS: Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin. Do you think this was an invasion of privacy? Where should school officials draw the line as to whether or not they are invading privacy? I do not feel that school officials looking at a myspace bulletin or page is an invasion of privacy. I feel that anything posed on the internet without restrictions is fair game for anyone to see, including that of authoritative figureheads or even governmental officials. People post on pages that are visible to the public solely for the purpose of other people reading it. Sometimes I feel that it is a cry out for help, for those that are not strong enough to actually go out and do it in person. If a student was planning on showing up to school and shooting a bunch of people, but first posted this intension, I feel that he was one of these people asking for help. Sometimes it is so hard to seek help that one will do anything to obtain it. Shooting would certainly cure the problem of not gaining any help, but someone who could talk to him before he actually shot and killed innocent lives would be even more beneficial, not only to the saved victims, but also to the shooter, because now he does not have to live the rest of his life in sorrow and morning. It is one less thing for him to have to talk about with remorse behind it. As to where the line for school officials should be drawn, I feel that it is fair to say that if a student thinks that they have set into play a security action plan (or privacy settings) that they should be able to trust that. Those settings were put into place on the page or program for a reason, and that is to prevent others form seeing or reading what it is that they have written. They are not asking for help in this form or fashion, and so thus should be respected into what type of privacy they desire. What it really again boils down to, is that if you are asking for help, it will find its way out, but if you are just writing to write something down and relieve one's emotions, then ones should not need to further their emotions to the public or have to explain them. Privacy should be honored by all parties if a privacy setting is put into place. I am glad that the school officials were able to catch this potential school shooter before it actually happened though. I wish that they or someone was able to do the same thing at Virginia Tech last year. However, it is best to take the horrible situation that happened at Virginia Tech seriously and at the same time also learn form their mistakes. I know that had his initial privacy been invaded then he would be extremely upset and angry, however it is better a temper then an outright shooting. Overall, I feel that if you show signs, or needed to be watched for a little while for others and your own safety, it is ok to be invasive of private property. However, if you do not exhibit any traits then their should be no reason for school officials to just randomly investigate its students.\"},\n",

       "   'output': 'Subject 15- GENDER DISCRIMINATION: Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States? If so, what can we do to change this? Do you feel that women are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise? Do you feel that men are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise? I do feel that there is gender discrimination is still a problem, but not always only with women, though this is probably the bigger area of discrimination. I know that for many jobs, most people feel like they would rather work under a man who holds a high position, because the thought is, is that women can not handle that type of pressure. It they do somehow make it past the glass roof, then they must be extremely uptight and unfriendly, all of which are stereotypes of course. The glass roof however, does exist unfortunately. The glass roof is a saying that is used to describe how most often women, are able to see the position in a job career that they would like and want, but are unable to reach and obtain it due to outside causes. These outside causes are mainly their other coworkers of boards of offices who elect those who are to receive raises and positions. Also, in the area of payment, women who are doing the same jobs as their coworkers who are men, often receive less payment. This is utterly unfair, because the jobs are the same, and perhaps the women has to actually work even harder just to prove her \"worth\" to the outside would and her company. Again, gender discrimination is not solely reserved for only the women, it can be against the men as well. If a man was to go into sales in selling dresses, the assumption is that they must be gay, and if they are not then they do not know what they are talking about. However, there are many men out there who have great opinion on dresses or even how to make clothes for women who are straight, and yet it is usually harder for them to gain the respect that they deserve. Perhaps this is because women feel men who are gay think more like them and thus are telling the truth, or have them in mind when designing the clothes, and straight men do not. This is again a stereotype that must be corrected, because men who are straight have just as much ability to do women\\'s work or design women\\'s clothes as anyone else. Another place where women are discriminated against would be in sports. Many women are extremely good at sports, but men do not hold their teams as in high a regards as they do men\\'s. This is utterly ridiculous, because like at some colleges, the women\\'s team might be first in their division, while the men\\'s team are loosing horribly yet still get more fans. This is quite unfair, and women\\'s teams should start to gain and obtain the respect that they deserve, because they practice just as hard as the men\\'s teams do. Overall, I feel that there is still discrimination, but that it all depends what line of work or field you are in to determine if it is against women or men. People should learn to be more respectful of both genders in any field, and could perhaps even learn new things from the opposite sex if society just allows them to teach us.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'One the issue of gay marriage, I belive that it should not be leaglied. Now let me first clarify what I mean by this. Marragie in the eyes of the church is between a man and a woman before god. Those of the same sex can not participate in such actions because the Bible and the catholic church do not recognize this form of unionization to be legal. The reason is because a man and a woman can produce children and thus help populate the world and spread the word of God. Those of the same sex can not produce children having the same organ system makeup, and thus are not considered a compleate whole or union in the eyes of the Lord. I compleatly agree with this, however I do belived that those of the same sex should be able to spend the rest of thier lives together and have the same governmental benifits as regular families. In other words, I belive that those who are of the same sex should be unionized but in a different way. If they so wish they can have their partnersip recognized by a new name as well other then marraige (because it is not a marraige) but have it sound more meaningful then just the dry term of civil union. In reality, this is mainly what most same sex partners want anyways. THey want a way to solidify thier \"love\" for one another in the eyes of others, and they want to be able to acces all of the benifits that normal male female relationships and marragiaes have. In regards to whether President Bush should be allowed to pass an Amendment banning Gay marraige, I do not think that this should be done. I again, dont think that there should be gay marraige (as said using this term) but under a different term I am ok with it. However, with President Bush passing an Amendment banning gay marraige it is almost making it seem that one is not free in this country any more. ONe should be able to choose who they wish to spend the rest of thier life with and not have to worry how others judge them. with an amendment, even if they did find a way to solidify thier union working around the amendment, I feel as if they would be looked down upon even more in society then it is already today, and this should not be so. THe Federal government should not be involved in people\\'s personal lives in regards to stating who is allowed to be involved or be partnered with who. If this were the case in the end, I fear that the book by George Orwell of 1984 would be coming to life with the \"Big Brother or Father\" thing going on. Oh, on another point, the reason why marraige between a man and a woman is more solidifying in the eyes of god, is because they are able to reproduce and thus even if the initial \"passion\" for one another dies out, they have children that they are now working together to rais in the eyes of the Lord. THose of the same sex can not do this and so ofthen thier relationships tend to dye out after the passion has gone away. To sum up what I belive, I believe that those of the same sex should be able to be unionized under a different term then marraige and taht the federal government and president bush should stay out of the sistuation. I also believe that once this universal differnt term to name the union between same sex couples is passes, all states should honor it.'},\n",

How do you feel about President Bush’s push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage? Should the federal government be involved in this issue? I do not think that the president should be allowed to even propose such an idea as banning gay marriage. I understand that he is a Christian, and that in the eyes of Christianity, gay marriage can not happen, which I agree with, being a Christian. However, I do feel that there are some things that can be addressed that would satisfy both desires of both groups of people. First off, I agree that there should be no such thing as gay marriage. Marriage is by definition between a man and a women (in the Bible) who can then produce offspring and raise a family if they so choose in the eyes of the Lord. For other religions too, it would be to raise their offspring in the eyes of whoever that head of the religious sect is. However, with same sex marriages, there is no possibility for the production of offspring, and thus the population would die out and there is no one to teach the religion to. I feel that if those of the same sex wish to get married, then it should be called something other then a marriage, because it is not ever able to be a full marriage as seen in the eyes of God. However, by calling it something else, other then the term Civil Union, which is also used for heterosexual couples, they can gain the same feeling of respect and trust as marriages seen though the eyes of the church. Insurance companies would be able to recognize them, and so would the government for tax purposes. They would be able to gain all of the governmental benefits as normal families (in the fact that it is a man and a women) are able to obtain. I believe that those people of the same sex should be able to partake in some sort of ceremony to solidify their union, and make it seem more personal. I do not however think that the government should be able to gain any say into the situation after it has been established that they are able to \"wed\" for lack of a better term. Other then the initial name and word usage approved by the federal government, they should not be able to tell which states allow it and which ones do not. The state governments should not be allowed to do the same either, because then that would be a form of discrimination. I do not think that there should be an amendment added to the Constitution either, because to marry or to have a union between the same sex is a personal matter. Personal choices should not be paraded around on a Constitution, so President Bush should not be able to ban personal choices. Our country is based off of freedom, and not purely rules and regulation. If it were then we would not be a free country. The constitution is about giving guidelines for our country to follow, not telling us what to do or not do at every point and turn of our lives.'}],\n",

Killing yourself by merely ingesting marijuana is almost impossible. On top of this, pot does not have the physical addictablity that alcohol or tobacco has. Alcohol also can cause violent mood swings and aggressive behavior. The worst that happens with marijuana is that you mellow out and get a little hungry. If the government were to legalize and regulate marijuana they could first of all make money off of it. There are taxes on alcohol and cigarettes that make the prices high, the same could be done with pot. Also it would take the danger of the drug being cut with something else by the dealer out of the equation. Marijuana could have massive medical implications, but due to its illegality we have no idea. At the moment only some states allow medicinal marijunana for terminal patients. I think a big problem is the villanization that has been attached to marijana as well. It will not \"ruin your life\" as some other drugs will do. I have a big problem with marijuana being grouped with other illicit drugs such as heroin cocaine and ectasy which are much more dangerous and addictive. It is nowhere near the level of these. I truly believe that pot is on the same level as cigarettes and alcohol. If one of these three is allowed then all should be. If one is not the others should not be legal either.

       "   'output': 'Of course the war in Iraq has caused controversy. All war causes controversy. Most people have been connecting 9/11 to the Iraq war, and that’s just plain not true. The government itself has even said there is no connection to 9/11. Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. There were no mobile labs. There was no anthrax. That being said, I disagree with the reasons we supposedly went into Iraq. Perhaps it was for oil, perhaps it was depose a dictator, but frankly, America is not the protector of the world. It is not our job to take care of everyone. Saddam Hussein may have been a horrible tyrant, but it is not our job to change that. The big question is, what do we do now? We have gone in, whether the reasons are valid or not, we are there. So, what next? We can’t just leave; we’ve left them with no recognizable system of government. We took theirs away and have left it in shambles. The “government” that’s in place is a puppet it’s not real. How can we leave them now? If we pull all of the troops out of Iraq in one fell swoop the society would collapse. The bigger question is whether they even want a democratic government. Perhaps, a democracy like we have here in the United States would not work in Iraq. The society has been around much longer and is much more set in its traditions. Who are we to decide that they should be democratic? We can’t choose what’s right for their country any more than we can force the rest of the world to give up their prejudices. I think the war itself has gone on far enough. Why is the US building permanent military bases in Iraq? It quite seems as though we are there to stay, which is not why we went in there in the first place. Besides which, we keep sending more and more troops in, but not many are coming home. We do not need so many troops there. Unless we are trying to create the American colony of Iraq, bring some of them home! Also, no one thinks about the fact that maybe, just maybe some of them just plain are not happy that we stuck our noses into their countries business. Who gave us that right? We are not the big brothers for the world. It cannot be our job to be the police force and the protector for the planet. We do not have the right to take over, and force our views on others. Not everyone in the world should necessarily be a democrat. It will not work in some cultures, they are just too different. I think this war was started on false pretenses and needs to end. However I do not know how that can be done, I am not a government strategist, we need to rely on them to pull us out gradually without allowing the government in Iraq to collapse.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'There are a lot of things one can say about the Catholic Church in this day and age. The Catholic Church has been around in various incarnations for centuries. It has changed and evolved since it began, but the big question is has it changed enough? There are numerous arguments against the Church changing, one of these is that the church cannot be wrong because it follows the teachings of the Bible. A glaring problem with this is that the Bible did not arrive by fax from heaven. It was written by man. Not only was it written by man, there are many books that did not make it into the bible, which were written. These books may have even lent more to our understanding of Christianity as a whole. The point is that the Catholic Church must move with the times. As humans change, so must the systems that serve as their support systems. Catholicism is working under the same rules it has worked under for centuries. Many of the rules and expectations from the church are antiquated and obsolete. Others were rules which were made for political and financial reasons and are now seen as religious obligations. The reason priests are not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church is a rule which was originally made to make the Church money. The land owned by the priests (on which the church stood) would, if the priest had a family, go to his son, rather than the church. This would cause the church to lose both the land and the church that stood on the land. Why shouldn’t a priest be allowed to have a family? In almost every other Christian sect a pastor is married or is allowed to, it gives them a chance at a full life. Priests are human, just like anyone else. They deserve the right to live as all humans live, with love, both emotional and physical. However, this is not the only way in which the church is stuck in the middle ages. Many other rules are outdated as well. Women are no different from men, so why should they not be allowed to be priests? Women have the same ability to be spiritual leaders. It is understandable that in older time periods women were seen as inferior to men, and it is even understandable that the church viewed women this way. The symbolism in the Old Testament makes it clear that women are more susceptible to “sin” in the eyes of the church. In modern times however, we know that women and men are no different from each other, and can do the same things. We have women in places of power in every other aspect of life, there is no reason for women to be kept down in the church. So many things about the Church are good, but so many others are the exact opposite. The Church needs to move into the twenty-first century. So many people trust in the Church as their guiding force, and so it must move with the times and keep ahead of the darkness that people face.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong?',\n",
       "   'output': 'What really is “gay marriage”? It is a socially, governmentally, and religiously recognized marriage in which two people of the same sex live together as a family. Many supportive of same-sex marriage often use the term \"equal marriage\" to stress that they seek equality as opposed to special rights. Opponents argue that equating same-sex and opposite-sex marriage changes the meaning of marriage and its traditions. I feel that the suggestion of reserving the word \"marriage\" for religious contexts, and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of civil unions is the best answer. Does our declaration not say all men are created equal? So, why should same sex couples be denied the same rights as heterosexual couples? I feel that civil unions between same sex couples should have identical legal status to a marriage, and partners gain all the same benefits and associated legal rights; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to next of kin status, and shared parenting responsibilities. Those who advocate that marriage should be defined exclusively as the union of one man and one woman argue that heterosexual unions provide the procreative foundation of the family unit that is the chief social building block of civilization. My issue with this argument is that then we should not allow couples that cannot have children to be married either. Also, those who do not plan to have children should also not be allowed to be married. The procreation argument cannot reasonably be used against same-sex marriage, particularly since technological advances allow gay couples to have their own related biological children. Supporters also argue that making it available to more people would strengthen the institution of marriage, and furthermore that same-sex marriage would encourage gays and lesbians to settle down with one partner and raise families. Others argue that marriage no longer retains a procreative function of the government since many governments offer child tax credits and assistance regardless of marital status. The example in our government of calling marriage an institution between a man and a woman infuriates me. It is just a bit more proof of the fact that the separation between church and state no longer exists. The fact that our president called for an amendment banning even a civil union between same sex couples is appalling. The president is the last person who should be allowing his religious opinions to cloud his judgment. It is understandable that gay marriage inspires its own set of passions, with opponents decrying it as a step that will undermine the very fabric of society while supporters posit it as an inevitable next stage in step-by-step acceptance of homosexuality by mainstream America. But why, is that wrong? Should we not accept our fellow man in all his many shapes and sizes. If religiosity is the main contender against gay marriage, is it not true that most religions advocate acceptance and the matter of turning the other cheek. My belief is that homosexual couples are no different from heterosexual couples and should be treated as such.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'People who say gender discrimination isn’t alive and well in our culture are dead wrong. Have they never heard of the glass ceiling? Sadly gender discrimination cuts both ways. It’s aimed both at men and women in our day and age. I think most people also aren’t sure what gender discrimination really is. It can be something small, like a man assuming the only reason a woman is upset is PMS, or a woman making a statement making the excuse “its because he’s a man”. Or it can be something much bigger like a difference in pay for two people doing the same job, with the only difference being their gender. How does gender make you any different from others? It shouldn’t even be a characteristic, which is counted. As if gender is the only thing that could be wrong, or causing a problem. Maybe the angry woman with “PMS” is just mean, and bitter and angry. And maybe the man, who made the mistake, actually had a reason for it. It even gets involved in careers. There was a very prominent film a few years ago, “Meet the Parents”. The father in this movie assumed that the main male character had become a nurse only because he couldn’t be a doctor. The character had actually scored well above average on his entrance exams for medical school. He made the decision to go into nursing, even though people always make the comment that it is a woman’s job. Which brings up the point, why do we have these kinds of distinctions? Is that not a form of gender discrimination in and of itself? Anything one person can do, another can do, regardless of gender. Now I’m not saying that restrictions should be lowered. In some cases restrictions need to be strict. Tests for firefighters should be the same for a woman as it is for a man. This may mean there are fewer women in the field but the women who are there can actually do the job. Restrictions and limits should be the same for women and man, sometimes restrictions are there for a reason. Another thing to talk about is the glass ceiling. It seems in some gender dominated professions the opposite gender can only rise so high. They then hit a barrier, which they cannot go through. Others will be advanced ahead of them merely on the merit of gender. Others will receive raises while their salary remains stagnant, again on the merit of gender. It sounds suspiciously like racism. How is it any different to discriminate by gender rather than race? Simple answer: It isn’t. It is the same as not allowing someone a seat on a bus due to their race, only this time it has been accepted for much longer. Gender is not something which raises someone above another, men and women are different in many ways, but those ways complement each other, they should not battle against each other. I’m not sure how the problem can be solved, but it certainly won’t happen immediately. It will take some time.'},\n",

       "   'output': 'First things first. President Bush is completely stepping over the line when he pushes for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. His reasoning is at its base a religious reasoning. Of all people the president of the United States should not allow his faith to cloud his judgement, and yet that is exactly what he is doing. There should be a seperation between the church and the government. First of all,not all citizens of the United States agree with his religious point of view. How can we base a law which will affect those very people to their core on one man\\'s opinion? I can see the point that some make that \"marriage\" is between a man and a woman. Ok sure, but then leave the word marriage in a church and allow everyone to have a civil union. This way everyone would be able to recive benefits from their life partner whether they be heterosexual or homosexual. Some of these same people however argue against even a civil union between same sex couples because these same sex couples cannot have children. Okay, if we\\'re going to use that argument then we cannot allow those couples who cannot have children or plan on not having children to have a marriage or a civil union either. Whatever law is made it needs to apply to all people not just marginalize one group. To me the law against civil unions against homosexual couples reminds of the Jim Crow laws against blacks in the early part of their freedom. How is this any different? It is discrimination against a group of people simply because of who they are. They cannot change who they are and they should not have to. They should be accepted into our culture as part of it. Which in fact they are.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this?',\n",
       "   'output': 'One of my big problems with marijuana being illegal is the complete hypocrisy of the fact that I am allowed to kill myself by smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, or eating transfats, but I am not allowed to make the responsible, adult choice of smoking/eating/vaporizing marijuana. It is almost impossible to kill yourself by smoking pot as I\\'m sure we all know. Don\\'t even get me started about the fact that marijuana doesn\\'t cause the violent, aggressive behaviors that alcohol does. Alcohol in general affects the mood more by jacking it up and then becoming a depressant. The detrimental health effects from the smoke are much less than those from smoking cigarettes, but inhaling any smoke does cause problems. These problems can be minimized by eating or vaporizing though. I also think there is a major problem with it being classified the same as other drugs like cocaine, heroin, meth, etc. When kids are told that smoking pot will ruin their lives/make them crazy etc. and they realize that this doesn\\'t happen, it illegitimizes the warning entirely, making it really easy to believe that since they were lied to about weed, then the adults must also be lying about the other drugs. It\\'s really, really dangerous. The fact that its illegal also makes it somewhat easier for many kids to obtain than alcohol, since while many people would never sell to a child, many people don\\'t care due to the profit potential. The illegality also creates so much unnecessary crime and violence that just wouldn\\'t happen if it were legal. How many people sell their homebrewed moonshine for incredibly jacked up prices? Why not legitimize and tax its sale, using some of the tax money for real drug education and rehabilitation programs? The way it is now, our prisons are out of control and filled with nonviolent offenders and the only government money being made from marijuana is a result of corruption. And court fees and or fines. By making it illegal, we also dramatically limit the amount of research that is done on its health and medical effects, whether they be positive or negative. Even though the federal law overrides the states that have medical marijuana programs, its still a positive step and I believe that if more states follow this trend, real results can happen. I\\'m not sure how I feel about the legalization of other drugs. I do think there are harmful drugs out there and of course there is a potential to abuse any substance really. I do know that what we are currently doing is NOT WORKING and that there are millions of lives ruined by both drug abuse-not marijuana-as well as the drug war\\'s effects. The punishment should not exceed the crime, and in the case of marijuana, as well as some other drugs, this is certainly not the case. The drug status of marijuana was in the very beginning yellow journalism. William Randolph Hearst and other lumber heavy-hitters in the 20\\'s gave hemp its \"evil\" makeover by redubbing it \"marijuana\" which gave it a foreign/exotic /unfamiliar/distrustful sound.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'The United States’ involvement with Iraq, otherwise known as “the Iraq War,” is a controversial debate within the United States which I support. There are many things that people look at as they judge the leader of the United States’ decisions. The fact that a great amount of Americans do not like President George W. Bush has a huge affect on how it appears that all Americans view the war. Throughout my teenage years, I have been a leader within Boy Scouts. I know from experience that a leader can not go anywhere without the support of his people. I have made mistakes as a leader within Scouts, but these mistakes could have been solved easier if my “followers” would have cooperated with me. I feel as though President Bush is in the same position that I was in back then. It is true that he is not the United States’ best, smartest, etc. President, but he is our leader, and America needs to respect that. I believe strongly that if a leader is believed in by his/her people, he/she can do many great things. I support the war in Iraq due to my steadfast faith in our country’s leader, President Bush. As I was surfing the internet on www.facebook.com, I found a group entitled “Thank God for Bush.” This group supported President Bush because he is our leader. I noticed that this group turned into a debate site about the war in Iraq which Bush is leading. Many people posted on the “wall” of the site their disbelief in the war, and their opinions on why it is pointless. In opposition to the protestors, one person posted on the wall a story of a child asking his father and mother, who were both soldiers, why the U.S. was at war. The father took the son to his window and told him to look outside and imagine that each yard in the neighborhood was a different country. Pretending that their yard was the United States and the boy was President Bush, the Father told his son to look out of the window and imagine that the man across the street was Sadaam Hussein. The father then told the boy to imagine that the man was throwing his family outside and beat them to death. The little boy wanted to call the police (U.N. in this case), but they would not help. As the man walked across the street to burn down the house of an elderly lady, he looked the boy straight in the eye. No one would help the boy when he wanted to get help, so the man across the street eventually ended up at the boy’s doorstep- stronger than ever. The point of this story, the father told his son, was that if he had stopped “Sadaam” before any of this happened he would’ve prevented all of the casualties. This story touched me and inspired me even further in my support for President Bush and his efforts in Iraq. After reading this moving story, all of my thoughts and feelings on the Iraq War became stronger. I knew that there is no point in starting something and not finishing it, especially something as serious as a war. As the story put the situation in the Middle East to perspective for me so that I could look at the world as though it was a neighborhood, I realized that all countries should look out for one another- no matter what the name of a country is. People should not only look out for specific countries, but instead look out for the benefit of all mankind. Everyone in this world should support all other humans, if their intentions are good. The United States’ war in Iraq has everything except bad intentions which is why I believe that Americans should believe in the United States’ efforts in the Middle East. #29'},\n",

Why anyone would post something as horrible as a potential school shooting on myspace is beyond me, and even more so if the person does not expect to be caught. The school was doing its job by looking out for all of its students. If anyone within the school system is in danger, someone needs to do something to fix it. The school needs to make sure that its environment is a 100% save place for kids to be. Did the school harm the person who was going to do the shooting? No. The school used myspace- since it IS available to the public- to TURN OVER the potential shooter. I don\\'t see anything wrong with the school turning over a student who was willing to kill others. Where should we draw the line for privacy though? I\\'d say that the school should not go on the internet to only get kids in trouble.

However, if the school is only looking for pictures of kids drinking, etc., then I think that that is an invasion of privacy.

Most people who would want marijuana to be legalized are \"pot heads,\" but I can honestly say that I have never smoked pot. Almost anyone who has smoked pot before would not be against its legalization. To state the opposite, most people who never want it legalized most likely have never even tried it before. I believe that the people who don\\'t want marijuana legalized are afraid of the drug and its affects on its users. I actually think that the affects aren\\'t bad at all. If you look at what it does to you, then I would be surprised if you would still dislike the drug with a passion. Here are somethings to consider: -It calms down the user -it slows down one\\'s movement -a lot of times it makes you happy -It has apparently never killed anyone If this drug is legalized along the same lines and circumstances as alcohol, then mostly good things would come out of it. Instead of violent/drunk parents, the \"abusive\" parents would be calm and stoned (they would ignore children, but it would still be better than physical abuse). Given, I do not know a lot about the drug, and this is only based off of what my friends have told me. In relation to alcohol, the drug can definitely be treated as something very similar. Laws should limit it to adults over 21 years of age, you can\\'t have it in a car at all in an opened bag, etc. The black market would decrease if it were legalized, and \"bad batches\" would not be smoked. As a closing statement, the government might as well make money off of it since a huge amount of America\\'s youth already does the drug.

       "   'output': 'Looking on someone’s privacy within a public school system should be something that is not looked negatively upon if students’ lives are at danger. The fact that school officials prevented a school shooting due to the discovery of a myspace bulletin fills me with happiness. I have talked with public school teachers about safety in the school system, and they said that parents drop students off at school with the idea that the building is a 100% safe place. Some people may believe that the school system’s looking on myspace was an invasion of privacy for the student who was caught. I believe that if the school system has a legitimate excuse for “spying” on a student, such as saving lives, nothing is the matter with what they did as long as they are protecting their students. If a person accuses the school system of spying on the student who was caught, then they need to look deeper into the actions of the student. As stated before, the student posted his intentions on a myspace page about the potential shooting. When looking at what the student did, most individuals do not realize that what he did was an outcry of what he wanted to do to the public. “Bulletin,” as stated on www.dictionary.com, is defined as, “a brief account or statement, as of news or events, issued for the information of the public.” The key words to focus on in this definition are “for the information of the public.” No one would ever post anything on a bulletin, with the intentions of the public not seeing the display. The fact that myspace is on the internet- an area filled with networks with the sole purpose of communication- also shows how obvious the student’s outcry was. Since the purpose of an internet bulletin is for the public to view, I believe that the school system did not invade the student’s privacy. It is obvious that if someone posts something for everyone to see, even people who a person may not like may be able to see that post. The fact that the school system caught this message was nowhere near an invasion of privacy for the student. It was just as easy for the school officials to see the bulletin as a regular person could in their home. The Public School System educates the public and looks after their children during certain hours of the day. The School System did not invade the student’s privacy because, as indicated in the “public” portion of the name, the school has just as much of a right to view myspace profiles as anyone else in the community. The line to draw for the Public School System in regards to privacy for its students should be clearly noted as a point where one student may endanger his/herself, other students, or the school at all. If a threat is not posed, then schools should not go online to look for things to accuse students of. If, however, a threat is posed, then the school needs to do its job by any means necessary to keep its students safe. If something is so obviously displayed to the point where School Officials can go on to the most popular website online and look it up, if the message is too private then the material should never have been entered to the website in the first place. Since the school in this prevention of the shooting helped save lives, then that’s all that should be talked about. Saving lives and safety in general has and will always be a bigger concern than an invasion of privacy within schools and around the country. 29'},\n",

I\\'m pretty sure that there is always going to be at least a little bit of gender discrimination in this world. It seems as though it has been incorporated into our culture since the beginnings of time. Since men are naturally more muscular than women, they will always be perceived to be the stronger and more dominant sex. Women, by their regular caring nature, will always be looked upon in that motherly sense. Physically, our bodies are made this way. Women can care for infants by providing nutrients through breastfeeding, while the men \"take care\" of the family with their muscles and toughness. I don\\'t think that there is anything anyone can do to totally eliminate the discrimination of different genders, but it can definitely be changed to a more equal state. I believe that, since society influences gender by producing things relating specifically to girls or boys (generally), there is only one way to get rid of gender discrimination. This way is to raise someone in a world not affected by society\\'s views on gender. This, of course, will basically be next to impossible- but if you want to throw your child on an empty island for the entirety of his/her life, it may be possible. This gender discrimination influenced by society is obviously part of the workplace, since the workplace makes up a good amount of society. I used to be employed by a real estate company, and I was a receptionist/secretary. This is not your typical job for an 18 year old male. My friends would joke around with the idea saying that I had a girly job, which I knew was true. (but hey, it paid good...) This job is definitely a girly job, and I can totally see that. There are more masculine jobs such as construction workers. These stereotypes go back to the physical nature of men vs. women, and how they are perceived. Construction needs muscles, and secretaries need...multitasking abilities??? ha ha. The point is that gender discrimination is DEFINITELY in the workplace, and throughout the world. This is not always a bad thing though- Is it hurting anybody? In these cases no, but that\\'s not to say that it doesn\\'t happen.

The Catholic Church has always been a target for criticism ever since Martin Luther, or even before him. The media currently loves to focus their attention on the Catholic Church, and all of its faults. It is most likely that everything the Catholic Church is facing is also happening in other religions, such as pedophilia, etc. If one selfishly changes a religion because he/she does not agree wholly with the views, then that person is not dedicated enough to that religion. If a religion is changed, then it is not that religion at all. Therefore, if the Catholic Church changes its ways to accommodate the twenty first century, it wouldn’t be the Catholic Church anymore. There is always a reason for everything within Christianity. A female can not become a priest because the religion specifically said that they can not. The option of becoming a nun was created for women if they wanted to become that committed in the religion. Another ridiculous change would be to allow priests to marry. The priests can not marry, because all of their love is devoted to God. These things are parts of the Catholic religion, and will always be a part of it. Most people who want the Church to change aren’t even Catholic, or are selfish enough to solely stay away from church because they don’t agree with one thing. Normally this “thing” is sex before wedlock. If one stays away from the church because of that, then they should re-evaluate their faith. It is like if a man loves a woman who has a shaved head. If he truly loves her, then the male will stay with the woman. If the man tells the woman to grow hair with the threat of leaving her, then did he actually love her? The answer is no, the man was too selfish to stay with the “love” of his life. Even though the hair would have made her perfect for him, he took his selfish ways instead of his dedication. Just because the media only focuses on the Catholic Church does not mean that the pedophilia does not occur in other religions. The media is one of the only reasons that people dislike the Catholic Church. Every few weeks it seems as though there is another case on a Priest who has committed a crime, or the Pope who has done something debatable. I have noticed that those stories make headlines, whereas if an important person in another religion does something of the sort, it is not magnified as much. If these exaggerations of the Catholic Church’s “mistakes” cause people to form the opinion that the Church needs to change, then they should form another religion similar to the Catholic Church. This, of course, would not be a “true” religion because of the fact that it was not created as a result of some magnificent occurrence. The example for the Catholic Church is that Jesus came down to help everyone on earth. What basis would this reformed version of Catholicism have? The new religion by itself would not have anything to base itself upon other than the religion of Catholicism (a true religion) - not an occurrence, etc.. Changing the Catholic Church to suit modern wants is ridiculous due to the fact that a religion is not its true self unless its followers believe what they were intended to follow.'}],\n",

       "   'output': 'Dear CMCC Study, Yes, of course gender discrimination is still and issue in the United states. It\\'s derived from a mindset our culture has inherited from millenia of paternalistically structured Western societies. I believe that gender discrimination, at it\\'s root, stems from ingrained cultural patterns, so any work to change it must begin at a very basic level. This means that it will take a long time to accomplish. I believe the work of feminist writers and theoreticians from throughout the 20th century have given us a good starting point, particularly those that deconstruct biased notions inherent in the linguistic norms of our language (the use of phrases like \"mankind\", or the preference for male pronouns when making general statements, for example). Basically, what I mean by this is that working against gender discrimination is a matter of changing attitudes, and that laws really only help on a superficial level. Yes, women are still discriminated against in the workplace and in other places, as are men (though not as frequently). I think that the percentages of women in higher-level positions in the workforce and in politics is still very revealing. And not to sound like a conservative pundit, but there is such a thing as \"reverse discrimination\" as well. While it is rarer, occasionally qualified men do receive the short end of the stick when it comes to promotions and things of that nature because of \"politically correct\" considerations.

People need to keep in mind that myspace is an open forum. This means that anything posted on it can be viewed by anyone else. Myspace does have a \"privacy\" option, but I\\'d argue that anyone who places information they wouldn\\'t want other sot see on the internet is asking for trouble. I think that since myspace is an open forum, school officials were within their rights to use the information they found posted. The student who was dumb enough to make the posting acted the same as if he had posted it on a regular billboard in a hallway somewhere. There are, of course, limits to the lengths law enforcement and school officials can go, and I believe that those lines need to be more sharply delineated. The Supreme Court has dealt with the privacy rights of minors in the public education system many times before, but questions involving the internet are relatively new and need to be worked through. An important Supreme Court ruling in the 1960\\'s (the name of which escapes me) involving students wearing arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War commented to the effect that \"Students do not leave their rights at the schoolhouse gate.\" I think that a students use of any form of internet communication which could reasonably be considered private should be respected as such.

       "   'output': 'Marriage under the law is a civil institution to which all age-eligible U.S. citizens should be entitled. To say that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and women conflates a religious view of it with a secular one, which is not the business of the federal government. There is no good reason I can think of that gay people shouldn’t be allowed to get married. The bias against gay marriage reflects a deeply ingrained homophobia in American culture that we still haven’t rid ourselves of, for no apparent reason. Furthermore, I don’t think that the federal government needs to be mixing in this issue; it will ultimately be determined by the courts anyway. Many advocates of gay marriage have already made the point that heterosexual marriages can be loveless, estranged, or even abusive, and these are still fully sanctioned in the U.S. Really, I can’t foresee gay marriages possibly ending in worse terms than some straight ones already do. The sole argument against gay marriage seems to be the one employing that oft-repeated “sacred institution” phrase. It might be a sacred institution in some religious practices, and organized religions are free to ban or accept whatever forms of marriage they want. It isn’t a sacred institution when a couple fills out some paperwork and is granted a marriage license, however, and that’s the only part of the government’s involvement that has any legal ramifications – marriages administered by justices of the peace and others notwithstanding, since they are officiating secular ceremonies. The law doesn’t stop gays from applying for driver’s licenses or gay bar owners from applying for liquor licenses; stopping them from getting a marriage license just does not make sense. Anyone who wants to have their relationship status as a married couple sanctioned by the federal government should be able to (with some exceptions for age and a few other factors). Gays are just as likely to have happy, healthy relationships, and even raise and provide good care for adopted children. It should not be the business of the government to go around denying recognition of this. I think that there is a generic threatened feeling that most straight males experience when they confront the notion of homosexuality. This could be because of cultural conditioning; in America, the idea of the macho Sylvester Stallone type has a very broad appeal, and that homosexuality endangers this. It could also be a leftover from a hunter-gatherer kind of instinct that details what a man should be on a subconscious level. Whatever it is, men need to get over it. I have mentioned men exclusively here, because it seems to me that women feel less threatened by the idea of lesbianism, for whatever reason. That is not to say that some women do not feel that way, but it seems as though in general this is not the case. In the end, state supreme courts will be the ones to decide the issue on a case by case basis. The attempt at an amendment banning gay marriage is self-evidently ludicrous, and isn’t something the Congress should bother with. Hopefully sometime in the near future reason will win out.'},\n",

My feelings about President Bush cannot be described in polite terms, so I won\\'t go there. The erroneous line of reasoning that concludes that the banning of gay marriage will protect \"family values\" is also absurd in itself.

       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: Do you feel the Catholic Church needs to change its ways to adapt to life in the 21st Century?',\n",
       "   'output': 'As with any institution that’s been around for a millennium or so, the Catholic Church is inherently resistant to change. That’s a nicer way of saying “conservative.” Because of this, it’s acquired the outward semblance of a frat, a good ol’ boys organization. The hierarchy has the power and money to preserve itself by any means necessary, and frequently the means involves covering up the less tasteful deeds of its rank and file members. A similar principle operates in political machines. That’s not to say that the Church hasn’t done and doesn’t continue to do a great deal of good in the world; rather, that the insular character of the Church as an organization can sometimes promote systems of abuse which remain carefully hidden. Asking the Church to adapt to life in the 21st century, though, is a little like asking a duck-billed platypus to fly the space shuttle. The theological character of the Church is at odds with many aspects of modern life on basic points. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I present for your edification exhibit A: The Church’s attitude toward homosexuals, or “inherently disordered persons,” as they’ve quaintly come to term them. Most people have come to accept homosexuality as part of everyday life in the 21st century world. The Catholic Church, however, insists upon seeing it as either the product of bad parenting (often in bizarrely Freudian terms), an “accident” in the gene pool, or just straightforward perversion. While most advocates for gay rights these days do indeed argue that it’s genetic, none of them would apply “accident” as the nominal word of choice. The Church’s views on women, after having had years of spit and polish applied, still look musty in a modern context, too. It’s hierarchy is of a doggedly paternalistic bend. Certainly, there have been many famous nuns and female lay members (Mother Theresa and Dorothy Day, for examples), but these women have wielded little power in the actual operation of the Church. This seems odd, especially in view of the fact that Catholic dogma reiterates repeatedly the idea that men and women were made for each other. If that were so, why are there no female priests? It would seem to lend a good deal more balance to the picture. Maybe balance isn’t the end goal, but I can’t conceive of what else it might be, and it certainly isn’t pedophilia. Marriage itself has been a big point of contention with and within the Church for some time now. Priestly marriage was initially banned because social views on inheritance complicated things for Church landholdings; priests with children often tried to bequeath the land to their offspring. This seems like a remarkably un-theological reason for enforced celibacy. These days, it isn’t as though a way around that contingency couldn’t be found with some creativity. Protestant ministers and others have been “ministering to their flocks” for centuries while keeping families at home, and this doesn’t seem to have caused any widespread detriment. But the Church likes to remain static, and so we’ve seen no motion toward the idea of a married priesthood, although, from a sociological standpoint, this would have a good deal of beneficial impact.'},\n",
       "  {'prompt': 'Write an approximately 500 word essay to the following prompt: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this?',\n",
       "   'output': 'Marijuana is one of those things that’s still stigmatized for few legitimate reasons, and most of the reasons people feel a certain way about it are also true of alcohol. One huge, bone-crushingly important, monumental difference between the two is this: the government can and does effectively tax the manufacture and distribution of alcohol (and tobacco, for that matter). Denver has taken a step in the right direction, and maybe the only step that needs to be taken. Since people are given permission to carry only small quantities, theoretically this still legislates against large-scale wheeling and dealing while preventing cops from having to divert time and attention to minor drug busts, which are often a waste of resources. Harsh laws against marijuana indirectly place a major strain upon the law courts and prison systems, since they’re forced to deal with every trifling case of possession or distribution that comes through. The resources could be better spent elsewhere, like stopping the influx of harder drugs into the U.S., or locating meth labs. It should still be a crime to carry and sell pounds of marijuana, but I’d guess that these kinds of cases make up a very small percentage of the total number. Other drugs have risen and fallen in popularity, but marijuana has been a consistent favorite of people of all ages and backgrounds. The government is wasting its time trying to eradicate its usage, as though getting rid of pot will solve some of society’s major ills. It’s a mind-altering substance in the same way alcohol is, and last time I heard statistics cited, the number of people killed by drunk drivers was astronomically higher than the number killed those who drive while high. Also, I’ve never heard of any “angry stoners”, but there are a lot of angry and abusive drunks. I’m not advocating marijuana usage as necessarily being a good idea, but there are a lot worse ones. As with most things, it’s not that harmful in moderation; in fact, the smoke is much cleaner than that of most commercial cigarettes. The problem is that it’s stereotyped as the gateway drug of choice of all manner of social degenerates, subversives, and general ne’er-do-wells. Oh, and young people. People frequently use it in excess, of course, but the exact same could be said for Loyola students who start going to bars on Wednesday and Thursday nights during the school week. Eventually, the government is going to have to confront the issue head-on, and that will be a political spectacle worth watching. Just imagine expert witnesses brought before Congress in order to testify on the nature of marijuana smoking. C-SPAN’s ratings will soar. But that’s besides the point. The point is that usage of drugs like marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco is ultimately one of personal volition and responsibility. If the negative effects of the latter two are minimal enough that we permit their widespread usage, there’s no viable reason the former shouldn’t be allowed as well.'},\n",

      "1. LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA: The city of Denver has decided to legalize small amounts of marijuana for persons over 21. How do you feel about this? Do you feel that marijuana and its effects are similar enough to alcohol that it should be legal? I do not really know how I feel about the legalization of marijuana. On the one hand I have heard that studies have come out proving that alcohol is actually more harmful the pot. Under alcohol, one loosed much their inhibition and many a persons have made extremely bad judgment calls because of this. I know personally of friends who have blacked out, gotten sick, and have even had sex when they didn't mean to, all because of alcohol. I am not saying that this can not happen and does not happen with the use of weed, but I have not heard it to this extent. I also know that people can get addicted to alcohol if they are not careful, and can eventually get cirrhosis of the liver. This is a serious problem because then people have to have a liver replacement, which can take a long time to receive because of the weighting list. If they do not receive one soon enough, they death is the only other answer. Again, I have not heard of this happening with the use of marijuana, but I am not ruling it out, I have just never heard of it. I do know, that from when I have seen other people use it that they tend to act really goofy, or settle down and just sit there. I also know that just from talking with people over time that I am in contact with who do use it frequently, they do not seem to be as sharp as they used to be. I am not really sure if there has been any significant case study of this, but I feel that it tends to kill of brain cells. I would have to do more research though, before I came to any conclusions about the drug. On a different lever outside of actually using it, I do feel that it should be legalized, because that way the government can monitor it. There are so many drug wars and gangs on the streets because of this drug, and there would be a lot less death in the inner cities because it would no longer be an underground market. Also, but regulating it, people would be sure to be getting the actual real pure substance, verses just filler or even poison mixed in with it. Another reason why it should be legalized is because it would help to get rid of the drug war outside of the United States, namely Mexico. Mexico has some of the biggest and cruelest drug lords in all of the pot selling business. Marijuana is actually a big cash selling crop, and the drug lords monitor who grows it and how much of the crop is sold, so much so that if something is messed up along the way, of if they find someone growing it/and or selling it who should not be, then bloodshed it often the only answer. With the legalization of marijuana, these drug lords would loose a huge part of their business, because we would be able to grow the crop on our own soil, and it would no longer be illegal, so many of the workers in Mexico for the drug lords would loose their jobs. There would be no need for smugglers anymore. So again, for these reason I am not sure if pot should be legalized or not.\n",
      "Subject Number 15: 3. PRIVACY RIGHTS: Recently, school officials prevented a school shooting because one of the shooters posted a myspace bulletin. Do you think this was an invasion of privacy? Where should school officials draw the line as to whether or not they are invading privacy? I do not feel that school officials looking at a myspace bulletin or page is an invasion of privacy. I feel that anything posed on the internet without restrictions is fair game for anyone to see, including that of authoritative figureheads or even governmental officials. People post on pages that are visible to the public solely for the purpose of other people reading it. Sometimes I feel that it is a cry out for help, for those that are not strong enough to actually go out and do it in person. If a student was planning on showing up to school and shooting a bunch of people, but first posted this intension, I feel that he was one of these people asking for help. Sometimes it is so hard to seek help that one will do anything to obtain it. Shooting would certainly cure the problem of not gaining any help, but someone who could talk to him before he actually shot and killed innocent lives would be even more beneficial, not only to the saved victims, but also to the shooter, because now he does not have to live the rest of his life in sorrow and morning. It is one less thing for him to have to talk about with remorse behind it. As to where the line for school officials should be drawn, I feel that it is fair to say that if a student thinks that they have set into play a security action plan (or privacy settings) that they should be able to trust that. Those settings were put into place on the page or program for a reason, and that is to prevent others form seeing or reading what it is that they have written. They are not asking for help in this form or fashion, and so thus should be respected into what type of privacy they desire. What it really again boils down to, is that if you are asking for help, it will find its way out, but if you are just writing to write something down and relieve one's emotions, then ones should not need to further their emotions to the public or have to explain them. Privacy should be honored by all parties if a privacy setting is put into place. I am glad that the school officials were able to catch this potential school shooter before it actually happened though. I wish that they or someone was able to do the same thing at Virginia Tech last year. However, it is best to take the horrible situation that happened at Virginia Tech seriously and at the same time also learn form their mistakes. I know that had his initial privacy been invaded then he would be extremely upset and angry, however it is better a temper then an outright shooting. Overall, I feel that if you show signs, or needed to be watched for a little while for others and your own safety, it is ok to be invasive of private property. However, if you do not exhibit any traits then their should be no reason for school officials to just randomly investigate its students.\n",
      "Subject 15- GENDER DISCRIMINATION: Do you feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the present-day United States? If so, what can we do to change this? Do you feel that women are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise? Do you feel that men are ever discriminated against, in the workplace or otherwise? I do feel that there is gender discrimination is still a problem, but not always only with women, though this is probably the bigger area of discrimination. I know that for many jobs, most people feel like they would rather work under a man who holds a high position, because the thought is, is that women can not handle that type of pressure. It they do somehow make it past the glass roof, then they must be extremely uptight and unfriendly, all of which are stereotypes of course. The glass roof however, does exist unfortunately. The glass roof is a saying that is used to describe how most often women, are able to see the position in a job career that they would like and want, but are unable to reach and obtain it due to outside causes. These outside causes are mainly their other coworkers of boards of offices who elect those who are to receive raises and positions. Also, in the area of payment, women who are doing the same jobs as their coworkers who are men, often receive less payment. This is utterly unfair, because the jobs are the same, and perhaps the women has to actually work even harder just to prove her \"worth\" to the outside would and her company. Again, gender discrimination is not solely reserved for only the women, it can be against the men as well. If a man was to go into sales in selling dresses, the assumption is that they must be gay, and if they are not then they do not know what they are talking about. However, there are many men out there who have great opinion on dresses or even how to make clothes for women who are straight, and yet it is usually harder for them to gain the respect that they deserve. Perhaps this is because women feel men who are gay think more like them and thus are telling the truth, or have them in mind when designing the clothes, and straight men do not. This is again a stereotype that must be corrected, because men who are straight have just as much ability to do women's work or design women's clothes as anyone else. Another place where women are discriminated against would be in sports. Many women are extremely good at sports, but men do not hold their teams as in high a regards as they do men's. This is utterly ridiculous, because like at some colleges, the women's team might be first in their division, while the men's team are loosing horribly yet still get more fans. This is quite unfair, and women's teams should start to gain and obtain the respect that they deserve, because they practice just as hard as the men's teams do. Overall, I feel that there is still discrimination, but that it all depends what line of work or field you are in to determine if it is against women or men. People should learn to be more respectful of both genders in any field, and could perhaps even learn new things from the opposite sex if society just allows them to teach us.\n",
      "Subject Number 15: 2. GAY MARRIAGE: While some states have legalized gay marriage, others are still opposed to it. Do you think either side is right or wrong? Why? How do you feel about President Bush’s push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage? Should the federal government be involved in this issue? I do not think that the president should be allowed to even propose such an idea as banning gay marriage. I understand that he is a Christian, and that in the eyes of Christianity, gay marriage can not happen, which I agree with, being a Christian. However, I do feel that there are some things that can be addressed that would satisfy both desires of both groups of people. First off, I agree that there should be no such thing as gay marriage. Marriage is by definition between a man and a women (in the Bible) who can then produce offspring and raise a family if they so choose in the eyes of the Lord. For other religions too, it would be to raise their offspring in the eyes of whoever that head of the religious sect is. However, with same sex marriages, there is no possibility for the production of offspring, and thus the population would die out and there is no one to teach the religion to. I feel that if those of the same sex wish to get married, then it should be called something other then a marriage, because it is not ever able to be a full marriage as seen in the eyes of God. However, by calling it something else, other then the term Civil Union, which is also used for heterosexual couples, they can gain the same feeling of respect and trust as marriages seen though the eyes of the church. Insurance companies would be able to recognize them, and so would the government for tax purposes. They would be able to gain all of the governmental benefits as normal families (in the fact that it is a man and a women) are able to obtain. I believe that those people of the same sex should be able to partake in some sort of ceremony to solidify their union, and make it seem more personal. I do not however think that the government should be able to gain any say into the situation after it has been established that they are able to \"wed\" for lack of a better term. Other then the initial name and word usage approved by the federal government, they should not be able to tell which states allow it and which ones do not. The state governments should not be allowed to do the same either, because then that would be a form of discrimination. I do not think that there should be an amendment added to the Constitution either, because to marry or to have a union between the same sex is a personal matter. Personal choices should not be paraded around on a Constitution, so President Bush should not be able to ban personal choices. Our country is based off of freedom, and not purely rules and regulation. If it were then we would not be a free country. The constitution is about giving guidelines for our country to follow, not telling us what to do or not do at every point and turn of our lives.\n",
